With all the information, there might be worry of the pace being off, but surprisingly it is done super well. Never really dragging, but not moving a blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi s combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters. The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.Character Development: The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang s life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.The Surprise Cameo: Can t say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character s return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.The Cultural Influence: Like Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history. I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale, and though again a little predictable and flaunting, really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others.The CGI Finally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do. Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves. Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed, the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements, and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects.The Acting: A great part played by all members on this film, extras included, Shang Chi s cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well. Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic, and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results. He holds much of the prodigal martial artist, disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style. However, he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum. Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays, but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past. I loved how well she was used in this film, and how great she complemented Simu in this role. Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character, once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist, and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi. So many other great actors and actresses in this film, but due to time restrictions I have to move on, but trust me they did well in their performances.The Comedy: Awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh, and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly. However, Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice. Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs, with well-timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy. There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place, but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up. And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie. It s all done so well and I was very happy with the results.The Action: My bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered very well on this film s action expos√©. The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture, and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema. It s exciting, it s dynamic, and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect. Used well in the story, there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking. Even more so, the strategies behind them and what is required to win, accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era, so well done on that too.A Bit More Adult: The movie is definitely showing Marvel s modernization into the 21st century, and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments. Cursing is definitely increased in this one, with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue, but not to the point of being overdone. No F bombs, but some of the language has got a little more bite, so caution. In addition, the tone of the tale is darker, and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor, Captain America, and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale, which again is a plus.Some of the political moments: While nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today, Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film. Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating, ""Look what I had to do,"" was a bit of showboating that I could have done without. Yet even this dislike is marginal, given it s very little occurring, has some nice moments that build off of it, and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in.A Little More Action:The action in this movie is great, and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film, and things I was not expecting. Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced, namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought. However, the fights at the end needed some more time for me, and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time. Star Wars has done this successfully in the past, showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle. Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films, but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt. The battle is lengthy enough, I ll agree to that, but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me.The VERDICT:Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago. A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation, this hero s quest had all the makings of a fun, exciting and swift adventure we were expecting. Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects, was a deeper movie than I had expected, using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose. Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie, and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book, though again caution with your little ones watching it. As for limitations, I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie, but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me. Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them. Overall, my scores for this film are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0."
1.0,5.5644,"movie, film, also, well, character, marvel, mcu, good, watch, great","First of all, my husband and I love superhero and sci-fi movies. We have seen most, if not all, of them either at home or on the big screen. We love the action, suspense, and thrills most of the movies provide. While this movie was visually appealing, it lacked the momentum that my husband and I are accustomed to from the MCU. Both of us fell asleep during the movie when things became so boring that we couldn t hold our eyes open. Towards the end, when they introduced the ""comedy relief,"" both my husband and I groaned. This movie did not need comedy relief; it needed action and suspense--neither of which appeared until the last 15 minutes of the movie. Compared to the last movie we saw, ""Free Guy,"" this movie fell flat on its face. Don t waste your money going to the theatre to see this; wait until it comes out on free Internet TV."

5.0,0.0,"great, film, marvel, really, movie, character, action, go, story, good"," Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings  is the latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring MCU newcomers Simu Liu as the titular character and Tony Leung as  Wenwu  and, at last, the definitive portrayal of  The Mandarin . Helmed by director Destin Daniel Cretton this picture injects the perfect amount of Asian culture into this enormous franchise.The cast is stellar, especially Liu who wished this role into existence years ago on social media and I couldn t imagine anyone else in the role. He has brilliant on screen chemistry with co-star Awkwafina who plays  Katy , Shang-Chi s best friend. Katy acts as the audiences lens into this world. She is just a normal person and I feel her role is pivotal in helping general audiences digest a story with this many magical elements. Thanks to Leung s performance  Wenwu  has become one of the best MCU villains. He is the excellent blend of menacing and sympathetic with understandable motives.The fight choreography is second to none in the MCU. They linked perfectly with the set pieces created for this film. They were excellent, in particular the Bus fight scene and the final fight between Wenwu and Shang-Chi. These brilliant pieces of action were achieved through the lack of camera cuts and smooth camera movements to exhibit the skilled choreography. Along with the set pieces, the overall look of this film is stunning. There are some especially beautiful shots within the final fight scene which makes up for some of the routine Marvel tropes which this picture eventually falls into.The main themes of family and grief are incredibly heartfelt. They re told expertly through these characters and are deeply rooted in Asian culture, something this film showcases with perfection. From the Ten Rings compound to the Golden Daggers Club in Macau to the fictional land of Ta Lo, the Asian culture is always on show and this film, along with the wider MCU, benefits from it tenfold.However, this film is not as perfect as it could ve been, thanks in large part to the Marvel formula which this picture falls into like many of it s predecessors. This is most apparent in the 3rd act which not only drags on for too long, but also turns into big CGI monster vs big CGI monster once again. When I believe a more grounded martial-arts style fight would ve been more fitting.Overall,  Shang-Chi  began as a breath of fresh air into this franchise, with deeply rooted themes, a gargantuan cast and stunning fight choreography until it gave in to the ordinary marvel formula which has plagued this genre since it s inception. Despite this, the future looks bright for these characters and the post-credit scene cements the titular character as an MCU mainstay for years to come.8.5/10."
