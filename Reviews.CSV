"I'll start by saying that if you're looking for a great story, you'll be disappointed. Shang-Chi is a pretty standard hero's journey at its core, which is a shame because the story could have been inspired by House of Flying Daggers and other wuxia titles.So why a rating so high? Because where the story falls, everything else excels.Shang-Chi is visually spectacular and a real treat for the eyes with some visuals that are incredibly distinct for the MCU. In regards to aesthetics, Black Panther walked so Shang-Chi could run a marathon.The fight scenes are all amazing. There's one weak fight, but it's meant to be weak, and they're all very long, which is great to see. One of the early ones went on for a solid 5 - 10 minutes, which was unexpected but far from disappointing.The first actual fight scene is my favourite in the MCU, and I was worried none of the others would top it, but they were all delightful to watch, and I was so glad they did a parallel of it later on. Either way, the writers went hard on the fight scenes and that paid off.In summary, the story is lacking, but I'm glad in a way because that allowed everything else to shine. And shine, it did. I hope future directors take lessons from the aesthetics and choreography of Shang-Chi."
"After 10 years of almost every movie being.armed combat, this one is fresh and the perfect start for phase 4 (yes, the start is with black widow but is something ""old"", too related to the previous phases), i loved every single moment, i got chills, i laughed. The soundtrack is astonishing, as the.cinematography. The best of the mcu if i may. Loved the colors. The fighting sequence leave you attached to the screen as they seem like they are dancing. All combined is something else, completely new and i can't wait to see more of simu liu as shang-chi because he was.brilliant.Go see the movie!!"

Perfect Fantasy film to watch with full family.. you can't miss this on big screen.
"Keeping it short. This movie had it all. Great story, writing, direction, acting, villain, comedy and fight direction.I'm a huge old school kung-fu movie fan and I was a bit sceptical about how they will show the fight scenes. Glad they kept it authentic with the fight director (who worked with Jackie Chan a lot). It was insane.The story itself was superb. The villain's character development was amazing. The direction was not rushed and at the same time it didn't bore me for a single second.Best non-avengers MCU movie for me. I can watch this again today after watching it last night."
"Brought to you by the Truth Tellers.Film is great overall and in this genre at least, is one of the best all year round that has been generally lacklustre. Definitely a good movie to watch as it does what it is supposed to in that it is generally a setup film for something bigger in the MCU.Like many of the other Marvel Films in the MCU, they have to start somewhere. As an origin film it does it very well and perhaps the best origin / starting film for superhero movies that is full of action, decent story that is somewhat predictable (as it is for most origin stories) though generally fresh, fun and great characters. Definitely one to watch.Final Verdict - Does what it is meant to do and provides the entertainment while doing it."
"Haven't been much of a Marvel guy even with their biggest event films, but Shang Chi is solid. Story moves quick, lots of great characters, almost nonstop action scenes, and a finale that they hid from the trailers. I was definitely way more into it than I thought I'd be. Props to the team on this one!"
"I had very few expectations from this one, given the fact that it was an origin story with a character I know zero facts about. But let me say this, it competes with the Avengers movies when comes to cinematography, visuals and action sequences.By far the best Marvel movie in the recent years, that puts many titles from its portfolio to shame.The visuals are a blast, a true eye candy experience. There are a lot of new elements that Marvel seemed to experience with and it worked out perfectly. The choreography is spot on, as the fighting sequences are among the best I've seen, and combined with a good score, it turns out to be a very enjoyable seeing on the big screen. I think it's mandatory to watch Shang-Chi on the biggest screen you can get to."
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining albeit formulaic popcorn Marvel film that's part-family drama and part-kung fu adventure that is raised by Tony Leung's villainous performance as Wenwu. It delivers a solid introduction to an Asian American superhero while paying tribute to Chinese martial arts films.First off, it's very pleasing to see the warm reception Shang-Chi has received across the world. It's a phenomenon to see English-speaking audiences intensely cheering for a subtitled film that has large portions in Mandarin. Back in my university days, the average Western filmgoer typically would not see a foreign subtitled movie on the account of not wanting ""to read a movie."" Look at how much the world has changed now.The first half of Shang-Chi plays much stronger. The San Francisco bus sequence is reminiscent of a Hollywood big-budgeted version of 90's Jackie Chan films set in Western locales, like Rumble in the Bronx, Who Am I or First Strike.The fight choreography moves from hard fisticuffs towards fantastical wuxia, and plunges into more and more CGI. The former is more engaging with Shang-Chi being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time in a real setting.Simu Liu does a solid job as Shang-Chi and has impressive moves. Like an athlete, he sells the hits and moves swiftly when performing parkour. Liu grew on me throughout the movie, much to the aid of the always-charismatic Awkwafina as his best friend Katy. They share a charming banter as if they were doubling as their own R2-D2 and C-3PO.The film's MVP is Tony Leung, who approaches his role with an award-worthy intensity, injecting a depth and gravitas to his villain that elevates the film to another level.I was amazed by the depth Leung achieved through his scenes. The scene that struck me was a flashback where Tony Leung's Wenwu comes home through his door and gives a look of concern to his own family. In that one glance, Leung portrays a completely different person in contrast to the villain in the present. His performance cut right through me and I felt I was watching someone suffer.It is unfortunate as Wenwu is undercut by the script introducing a second villain late in the second half, which diminishes Leung's character. Wenwu is established as an immortal who's fought for power through the ages, yet there's a lack of wisdom in his latter actions that felt unconvincing.Shang-Chi's third act takes a strange turn into mythic realms and loses the gravitas that was promised in the first act. The story shifts into a westerner's stereotypical view of China. We get the straw hats, the rice paddy village that looks Cambodian, and the constant mention of dragons. With a CGI-infused finale spectacle, the movie then exhausts all the good will earned from the first half.Shang-Chi is entertaining Marvel fare that will be remembered best as a cultural zeitgeist icon for Asian American representation. However, as a film, I don't feel the need to revisit it anytime soon. When I will, it will be for the San Francisco section and Tony Leung scenes.I am Asian, not Asian American. I'm happy for other Asian Americans who feel represented by Shang-Chi. I personally do not feel that representation from this film and am fine with that. Looking at the film itself, I admit Shang-Chi is one great step in the Asian American representation fight. However, it's apparent there's still a heck of a long way to go..."
"First off, this is a decent movie.Sure, there's a buttload of tropey nonsense, small furry Disney creatures and all that, but overall it's a good MCU inclusion and Simu Liu is great, as are MOST of the other actors.The story is pretty decent, although a little over the place in parts, and does a pretty nice job of including it in the overall MCU as well as adding some nice Chinese mythical callbacks or whatever you would call them.The acting is excellent, especially Tony Leung who I would say is the most relatable antagonist since Marvel's Daredevil and the superb Kingpin.However, there's some pretty bad parts too. Awkwafina does well to not be quite as annoying as she's been in other parts, but is given WAY too much credit and screen time considering she's just Shang Chi's buddy and has no actual skill or reason to be there. Especially with how's she's treated by Wong later in the movie. Why Marvel needs her to be included quite as much I've no idea. Especially considering how great Shang Chi and his sister were in the film.Lastly, the fight choreography. It is VERY good. An absolute tribute to the late Brad Allan and was a joy to watch. Especially the close up work and the Chinese weaponry which was displayed super well.Overall, it's well worth a cinema visit. It's a good film and doesn't deserve all the 1 star reviews AT ALL."
"I watched this movie after Twitter was claiming it to be the best movie ever, so I went with high expectations, after watching what I found is movie was mediocre at best, the CGI was great but apart from it everything is just ok at the best, I didn't connect with any character at all. To be honest wait for the film to come on streaming services, not worth it to go to the cinema."
"It's a decent movie. Happy that the comedic timing in certain scenes isn't overdone and it plays out to be a little more serious. The Mandarin in the movie by far the best acted out character and the choreography of the martial arts is on point. The movie is probably about 15 mins too long just when you think ""oh it's finishing up"" there's more. There is a notable difference in the second act with the story going more rapid and pacing is definitely the movies biggest flaw. Acting wise it's cool, nothing amazing or something you haven't seen before.If you're familiar with marvel it's the exact same model as some of the other movies with it being about family (Thor, Black Widow).Wanna have a good time with the family or just a decent watchable movie? This is one that you'll like."
"I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.Disney work through the numbers on this film, there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin.The acting is good, special effects are solids and the story is not bad.There's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans.I would actually pitch this at 7.5/10, not quite an 8 but higher than a 7Those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark, this film is not that bad."
"If you are like me, from the previews and ads you thought this was a Kung Fu movie about a son rebelling against his crime lord father and the father sends men to force him to return and make him take over as the next leader of the criminal empire. Not an awful plot but not that original either. That is absolutely NOT what this movie is about. I love and hate that Marvel's trailer seldom give anything away and I am glad they are doing it again. That is not at all what this movie is about and I will not spoil anything.The performances are good, the story is good and while not complicated, it keeps your interest. Funny parts, touching parts, action parts, it is overall just a good movie that was enjoyable to watch. It is not one of the best Marvel movies but it is a solid one and worth seeing in the theater."
"That was a freakin' blast! The story is complex and interesting it fills some gaps in the MCU and simultaneously is a great origin story for the character of Shang-Chi.The whole cast is amazing, I mean there is so much chemistry between them. Simu Liu and Tony Leung are phenomenal in their respective roles. The Mandarin tho...so well created character.The movie is amazing bridge between East and West culture. There is so much to explore, much like Wakanda. The history of Shang's culture is so rich.The fight choreography is absolute kick in the gutts...in a good way. I mean this is something completely new for the MCU and they deliver it again! Everything looks so goddamn good and I can't help myself thinking about some scenes! Also, the colors, the effects, the camera work and etc. Everything is magnificent.There is humor for sure, but there is also emotional impact. This is not some bland action packed movie, it's made with heart from fans for the fans. Kudos to the director Destin Cretton!Killer soundtrack and the main song for the movie ""Run It"" fits so good with all.There are a few surprises, that were hidden from the promos and trailers and man...just wait to see them.About the credit scenes...they are two, both are good, but one of them is...SICK!For sure deserves more than one viewing in the cinema, so much story building, details, action, fun. The people who underestimated this movie will be so surprised how great is it."
Shang-Chi was honestly amazing. The cinematic experience was great and the story and plot of the movie was very good too. I am a huge marvel fan and it makes me happy to see that they are branching out to different types of hero's from all types of backgrounds. To sum up my review I really enjoyed it and highly recommend. (stay for the credits to the end)
"The was really good better than I expected,it has a great story,best hand to hand fight scene and more! I can't wait to watch it again more than 10 times I absolutely love thisüî•."
"The film contains a lot of confusing plot points that really make the whole story look underwhelming and uninteresting.Why is Shang Chi's father so blind (or stupid) that he cannot see he is being deceived by some otherworldly being? Even after he sees that he released some kind flying demons out? And after Shang Chi tried to politely explain him this a few times?Oh, and the father was just wasted within seconds and the mega-powerful ten rings didn't help him much.And this otherworldly being... The CGI monster. What exactly is it? It turns out to be the main villain of the film, but it's hard care about it at all.I loved the jokes in the movie, and the first hour was fine, but the rest is just disappointing."
"This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The hero of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience. Also the martial arts and action scenes are a treat to watch and the core of the film is about family."
"This movie is much better than black widow, it's funny, it's exciting, and full of adventure!Must see this summer!"
"Couple of things, 1. The actors are made of plastic, I know it wasn't a CGI cartoon but the actors were so one dimensional it may as well have been. Have never seen live actors display the uncanny valley. 2. Feels alot more like a Disney film and less like a Marvel super hero movie. 3. It was super formulaic, Awkwafina was as usually not funny and every little chuckle was super forced. Overall had some good fight choreography but you can get that in any other Kung Fu Movie. Kind of makes you wonder why so much money was spent on a very very very template movie. Kind of lame."
This is well done as far as special effects but the plot is so boring I couldn't take it and left in the middle of the film.
Shang-Chi inovates in Marvel Cinematic Universe with amazing action choreography that will keep you invested at all times.
"Solid performances, some of the best action sequences in the MCU, visually stunning and likeable characters. This film is not only an achievement for a marvel film but also a film on its own."
"Martin Scorsese called most of these generic MCU movies theme park movies and This movie is perfect example of that. There are some great MCU movies, but seems like Marvel isn't even trying to separate themselves from theme park stigma, when they make movies like this."
Overall it's nothing new or very creative. I have no idea why some people pretend like it's new coming of movies. It's not. It's meh at best. Wait for streaming!
"Well the fight scenes were exciting , the story was incredibly slow. Not the best Marvel movie but not as weak as movies like Thor: The Dark World. Some of the best visuals in any movie I have seen which helps improve the overall experience. Keep an eye out for a fun character to pop up as well!"
Such a good movie. The asian representation is on point. If I could give this movie past a 10 star rating I would. Can't wait for what else marvel has in store.
"'Shang-Chi & the Legend of the Ten Rings' (or SCLTR?) feels like the proper start of MCU's phase 4, with a clear link forming to 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness'. We're first introduced to what seems like a Chinese fairytale, as we follow Wenwu (Leung) and his millennium of power with 10 enchanted rings/bracelets. We then meet Li (Chen), who turns out to be the mum of Shang-Chi (Liu) & Xialing (Zhang).How the mystical realm of Ta Lo fits in and it's secrets aren't revealed until the third act, and after the intro, the film does well to show Shang-Chi & Katy (Awkwafina) living their somewhat unfulfilled lives in San Francisco, before the action starts to heat up when Shang-Chi goes looking for his sister. All the actors are very likeable, especially Leung, who does a great job of making sure Wenwu doesn't descend into a caricature of a bad guy, but truly feels like a misguided father. Some great cameos also round everything out and it's always great to see Michelle Yeoh.While a bit slow in some parts, the martial arts scenes and action near the end are great, without being overwhelming - certainly up there with 'Hero' & 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. Also a nice nod to 'Raya & the Last Dragon'! Nice ending and character arc for Shang-Chi - I look forward to seeing him find his place in the MCU."
Just an another amazing movie brought by MCU with adding a new character to marvel universe. Overall fantastic movie with the point of view of storyline and action sequences which really are one of the best among all marvel movies till now. It is clearly visible by this movie that there's something big planned by MCU in future which would be amazing to watch. At last just watch this movie you will love it.
"Another forgettable Marvel film, story is the same old but this time it's the asian version, I think the biggest issue is it's too long or else some of the action were good."
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a wonderful movie in so numerous ways... Visually striking, with a great mastery of the staging from beginning to end.So much visual poetry, the legend/adventure aspect of it is really top-notch, with legends & mystical elements that grab you ever more with the story unveiling before your eyes ... The humor is very pleasant (Katy, played by Awkwafina, brought a welcome energy & heart in each of her scenes) and adds a pretty pleasant flavor to the whole adventure.I really loved the way the characters are written, with Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) as a complex & layered figure all along the movie... And Xialing (Shang-Chi's sister, played by Meng'er Zhang), as well as Li (their mother) are both highly enjoyable to see express themselves on-screen, they both have a lot of presence (and skills), each in their own ways.I found the entire movie very coherent, every detail makes sense and is counter balanced in a way or another... Yes, there is a strong notion of balance (darkness & light, and so on), with a lot of messages infused in both the action & dialogs. It is an extremely entertaining movie, but I really wanted to emphasize the richness and depth of its story/mythology and characters, all connected in the most organic way.By the way, I loved the whole Asian/Chinesz myths & legends aspec of the movie, the spirit & philosophy of it all was a true delight to my eyes, with countless Sci-Fi elements entwined in it, but all smoothly integrant of this mythology...
I think I probably put it in my Top 5 Marvel movies... I found the staging really majestic, from the dialog scenes to the action scenes, the humor, the flashbacks, and this new ""universe"" (mythology) that is presented here, it just all flows in such a delightful way from beginning to end.Marvel Studios always are very very clever at hiring a great variety of talents, and they nailed it once again... Destin Daniel Cretton (the director of the movie) is super creative and manages to construct pretty complex scenes while always masterfully telling a story, building a deeply cohesive piece ; it's all fantasy but nonetheless feels visceral and real. This movie is another Marvel movie you often forget that it is a Marvel movie, precisely because of its powerful and so deeply captivating mythology, and this emotional weight that you can feel over the characters, it truly sets something different. It felt like I was watching a movie in the vein of certain epic Asian adventure/martial arts movies... Gotta admit it's my jam, so... In addition to the Marvel stuff, it's a very pleasant feeling.The energy in the movie theater was fun, lots of people were excited from all these scenes that just grab you. Because yes, clearly... There is a good number of mind-blowing scenes in this incredible movie ! The photography and color treatment make the movie very striking... And like I said, certain scenes mesmerize you because of their beauty & mastery, or even their grand epicness ! At times, it feels like an epic fresco that you are contemplating.The scene when/where the two parents meet for the first time is beyond gorgeous (the setting, the colors, the choreography, the costume design and overall design, the music & sound effects, the characters and the atmosphere as a whole) ; an absolute masterpiece of art, visually way beyond sublime, what a gift for the eyes, wow... And the 'Grand Final' is quite simply epic, emotionally grabbing, and of course stunning visually, with a flow of glorious shots that all are impressive.A jewel."
"The best amount of tension and humor, with a great storyline and great characters. LOVED IT."
Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the best comic book movies I've seen! Great humor and intense action throughout the film! You can sympathize with the villain! The music is phenomenal (possible MCU best). Go watch it!
"Shang-Chi, is an excellent Kung-Fu movie. And it's the less ""Marvel"" movie of the Marvel movies. I mean that as a compliment. There's not much connection to anything else. Not 50 characters included for no reasons. Not a ""check it out guys, it's gonna be so cool in the next movie, I promise!"" vibe, that damages the story.It's basically a less poetic and less romantic ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Michelle Yeoh (still friggin awesome and butt-kicking at 59 years-old) is even playing in both movies.There's pretty colors, fantastical elements, comedy elements... but under everything, there's a cool story of revenge, of abandonment, of murder, of family and grief. Well, it's a great Kung-Fu movie, not a formulaic super-hero movie.Simu Liu is really charismatic and the fight scenes are awesome (some still sucks, though, because of too much CGI).The actress that plays Shang-Chi's sister is great too and I hope we see her in more movies.Well, everybody is fantastic in the movie (especially Ben Kingsley).It's been a while that I didn't loved a Marvel movie so much and it gives me some optimism on what can still happen with the MCU."
"With no real concept of the character or the story, I didn't really know what to expect from Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. I was pleasantly surprised. This Marvel action film is above average, and features impressive visuals, engaging action scenes, and entertaining characters. There are some missing pieces in the story, which they may be saving for later, but overall, I enjoyed this introduction to a new MCU superhero."
"The story is good, the visuals are out of this world. You'll definitely enjoy it‚ù§üëå."
"Amazing martial arts and epic fights, but it lacks plot in the ending and it's quite bland. Still it's one of the best hand to hand combat MCU-movies I've seen. Good usage of comedy as usual for the MCU."
"It is a story of self discovery, full of great character arcs, glorious fight scenes and The cinematography, choreography, plot - it could not have been done better. Simu Liu really shines as the main character: he brings so much charm to the role that it's easy to grow fond of him. CGI and the fight scenes were stunning!The perfect start for phase 4 (I know, the start is with black widow but is something ""old"")Marvel hasn't made such a masterpiece since Black Panther."
"Just the poster alone says it all, the movie was great. Great writing, great character development, story, acting, villain, comedy and the best fights.Like I just wrote the story was great, maybe you can say AMAZING. All of the character development was awesome to see and really entertaining. It was not at all rushed in the direction and at the same time didn't it bore me.So save to say, it was one of the best non-avengers MCU movie for me. I would watch it again and maybe even three times after that.(sorry for my englis, I'm Russian (Taskmaster yk))"
"I had very high expectations and Shang-Chi still blew me away. Definitely the best Marvel movie to date, the story was great. The villain wasn't boring and didn't have lame motives, the characters were well written, the music was fantastic and the fight scenes and special effects were amazing. It's also a very easy movie to understand and enjoy if you aren't very well versed in Marvel movies as it's Shang-Chi's introductory movie. Highly recommend."
"I was not expecting that, I had visions of a film along the same lines as Snake Eyes, that was an out of date bagel, this was a four course banquet.Fast paced, energetic, and relentless, not particularly the genre I normally go to, or enjoy, but I loved every second of it, a visual masterpiece. Superb acting, terrific musics, but it's produced in such a magical way, it is stunning.I plan on seeing this again, just to understand a few bits a little more.Go and watch it, you'll love it, 9/10."
Extremely overrated movie for no reason at all. It doesn nothing new. Only thing marvel has left is Spider-Man right now. Everything else is just super meh.
"Shang Chi is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Destin Daniel Cretton creates a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for the villain, Mandarin . Shang Chi is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking and one of the best action set pieces of this year which is the bus scene."
"It's one of the best marvel/origin movies to date. Can't wait for what's next. It was action-packed, hilarious, and emotional. Family at its heart/core. The story was EPIC, visuals were great. It redeemed Iron Man 3 and Ten Rings. Wenwu was amazing, one of the best and memorable Marvel villains. Simu Liu shined as Shang-Chi, it was made for him. His portrayal made Shang-Chi an instant fan favorite. Co-stars were also amazing, they portrayed their roles perfectly. Especially, Xialing and Katy, such great characters. A must-watch."
"For a guy like me, that grown up watching Jackie Chan's kung fu movies, this film was a wonderful experience!Besides all the perfect fight scenes and amazing special effects the story telling was terrific, I was completely moved by Shang-Chi's story and his family's.And the ending was awesome as well! I don't have too much to say, just a wonderful feeling that this movie gave me!"
"I really liked the movie. The fight scenes were great and CGI was excellent. My only confusion was why some characters were so shocked that there were mystical creatures and the story that Shawn and Katie was telling their friends was so unbelievable to them especially since the timeline of this movie takes place after End Game. Did they not see aliens come down with crazy abilities? I think once this happens, someone has to believe that anything is possible."
"Does everything the MCU does very well, a few of the things it does poorly, and then brings a whole lot of new elements to the universe. Incredibly enjoyable ride in theaters. At worse, you'll leave feeling like it was pretty good."
Okay so I know black widow was good and all but this oh my God this is the marvel magic movie of the year I laughed felt a rush of action and adventure threw out the entire movie it's just flat out fun to watch like every marvel movie should be so much fun so much to enjoy i highly recommend it to almost anyone. So much enjoyment here.
"Right now only MCU movie that actually has any passion behind it is Spider-Man No Way Home. Shang-Chi was just another generic origin story, but of course i went to see it, just so i could write this review."
This movie was awesome. It felt like an entirely different experience with amazing CGI. Tony Leung really shone in this movie. It definitely focuses on introducing new characters unlike what people think that these solo mcu movies are just there to set up for a must see event.I just don't understand why people are rating this one star when it hasn't even been released in the majority of countries. People just be hating for no reason.
Although i watched hall print bt this movie was too good that i can't even blame the hall print.
"I left the theater almost speechless, I went in with pretty high expectations, As a Asian-American person I didn't really know what to expect from the MCU since it was really their first time introducing this type of culture and character into their franchise, but after seeing this it met all my expectations from the cinematography, to the lore of Chinese mythology and action. I hope this film gets the hype it deserves it ties in with the bigger MCU and leaves some mystery for the anticipation of more."
"This movie is it, the whole time I was in awe, everybody in the theater were. Don't read anything, watch it, it's worth the time and money and everything. Marvel outdid themselves. This is phase 4 people, this is it.Fantastic directing, fantastic editing, fantastic CG, fantastic soundtrack. My expectations were surpassed. I recommend it to everyone."
"Overall it was a pretty bland movie. The plot was uninteresting and boring. There's not as many fight scenes as you'd think. Most of the characters didn't have a lot of personality. And Shang's girlfriend was incredibly annoying.It had it's moments though. There's a certain character that brought some fun scenes to the film.It's definitely one of the lower tier marvel movies, but it was still worth watching."
"I saw ""Shang_Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", starring Simu Liu-Taken_tv, Kung Fu Cops; Awkwafina-Jumanji:The Next Level, Ocean's Eight; Tony Chiu_Wai Leung-The Grandmaster, Hard Boiled and Michelle Yeoh-Star Trek:Discovery_tv, Mechanic:Resurrection.This is the first Asian Marvel super hero movie that is based on a minor-not as well known-character. I grew up loving 'The Master of Kung Fu' because of the martial arts aspect and still have the original comic books. FYI: Shang_Chi was originally based-visually-on Bruce Lee. Paul Gulacy-one of the artist at the time-even drew Shang_Chi to look like Bruce Lee. They also made changes-mainly because of political correctness-to his origin story. Originally, Shang_Chi was the son of Fu Manchu, a racially insensitive character. But now, it has been changed to be the son of The Mandarin, an old Iron Man villain. In the comics, The Mandarin had 10 rings on his fingers but here it has been changed to rings on his forearms. These rings shoot energy force bolts and Tony also calls his evil organization, 'The Ten Rings'. Simu plays Shang_Chi and Tony is the Mandarin. In this origin story, you learn what caused their estrangement and why Tony is wanting so badly to reconnect. Awkwafina plays Simu's best friend that tags along on Simu's adventures with glimpses into his past & present life-and lots of fantastic martial arts-and Michelle play's Simu's aunt. If you like The Eagles, you'll probably enjoy the connection to 'Hotel California'. There are several cameos, including a couple of Avengers. As the end credits start, there is a scene and another one at the very end so don't leave too early.It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes.I really enjoyed this movie and would buy it on Blu_Ray."
"Some of the best action scenes yet, great backstory and character development, one of the best MCU ""Villians"" yet, overall very refreshing and enjoyable."
"The fight scenes, creature designs and set are absolutely amazing, but overall story was sort of slow. Visually stunning but yet I couldn't help but feel it's a bit overrated. It also felt less connected to the mcu than most Marvel films and the first Wong/ Abomination cameo felt very out of place."
"When the movie first started... I felt like I was watching a ""foreign"" film. No English just Chinese with English subtitle? Didn't know what to expect in this movie. Then later on, the casts started speaking English & the awesome fighting scenes kicked in. OMG!! How exciting~ The fighting choreography was unbelievable. Just as good as Jackie Chan movies!The storyline was alright but the CG was very good. They used lots of Chinese culture tradition, costume & symbols. Looking forward to see the next sequel."
"I have to agree with another reviewer here...it's probably the least Marvel of all the Marvel movies. Had it been edited to a certain effect, one would not be able to discern it as a Marvel film.It's a background story of Shang-Chi obviously, but in a way, I felt like Tony Leung stole a bit of the show. It's his anguish that drives the film, as without it, there wouldn't be a conflict between him and Shang. Seeing Tony onscreen after so many years makes me want to go on a Tony Leung marathon, or at least watch Hard-Boiled again. He's always been so good at conveying emotion without words.Michelle Yeoh has small part in the film, but as always, she kicks ass and more or less plays the same exact role she played in the recent Gunpowder Milkshake as the older, wise Auntie.Simu Liu and Awkwafina have good chemistry in the film, but I actually felt like their characters otherwise were a little bit flat, as there was not much time spent on character development. Or at least in the character of Shang, alot of time devoted to flashbacks but little time spent with Simu in the present day, fleshing out his character. They seem like they would be fun people to hang out with? Awkwafina is vital to a plot moment, but otherwise, she has little presence other than a few small comedic moments but maybe that is enough.Morris is cute. I need to find that stuffed animal...The special effects are fun to watch and colorful.The plot is a bit simplistic, as it usually is with Marvel films. It's serviceable enough, but the film starts to fall apart during last 1/3-1/4 of the film when the fantastical elements show up and certain things happen that don't quite make any sense (or at least I haven't worked out why they should make sense). The fantasy elements don't quite work as well as just watching all the fight choreography from the earlier parts of the film, it's just not as interesting to me personally.All in all, a good time and a great prelude to a Labor Day weekend!"
"Marvel, you sneaky SOBs, is there nothing - I mean NOTHING at all - that you can't
turn your hands to? I'll be the first to admit that I was very sceptical about what really amounts to a glorified Kung Fu movie finding its place in the MCU. I need not have worried. Shang Chi sits right up there with the very best Marvel has on show.Simu Liu and the ever wonderful Akwafina make a fantastic duo and the addition of the queenly Michelle Yeo and the wonderful Tony Leung is the icing on the cake. It's exciting, adventurous fun. So go see it, you definitely won't regret it!"
"Oh is it beautiful.The coregraphy, the fights, the landscape, the colors...The story and the script is previsible, it's good sometimes to have something classic and there it works.I always though marvel universe movies have less fight , all reunited, with a classic Hong Kong movies such John Woo ones.Here my toughs are listened and this is easely the most fight based of all MCU movies ever.I had a great time. Great subjects, editing, actors.I have preferred this one globally than Black Widow because i see and live what i was expecting and even more."
This movie reminds me of the old kung fu movies of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. The fight sequences are extremely well shot and choreographed and Wenwu might be one of the best villains of the MCU. Simu liu is a very charismatic actor and I'm hoping he gets his own sequel. Definitely recommend everyone to give this movie a watch.
"A dazzling visual and special effects phenomenon that brought acting, fight scenes and story telling together to bring us one of the top Marvel movies to the deserved Big Screen. I wanted this to be great and it exceeded my expectations, well done by all involved. Kevin Feige's super power must be to bring people together and letting do their their story without controlling every aspect of the production."
"So recommended.I enjoyed this movie a lot, Stunning CGI and cinematography, and I liked the cast and the story.Welcome to the circus Shang-chi :)"
The Plot of Shang-Chi is extremely entertaining with twists and turns. The World-building is spectacular. The Characters are extremely well written with depth unlike most marvel movies. A must watch for Marvel fans.
"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings just became one of my absolute favorites of the entire MCU! Destin Daniel Cretton delivers an entertainment-heavy movie with arguably the best action ever seen in the cinematic universe. Through the outstanding mix of long takes, impressive fighting choreography, and jaw-dropping stunt work, Simu Liu shines with his martial arts skills, but also in tackling the identity issues of the protagonist. Marvel gains yet another emotionally compelling antagonist, as well as a relatable female character that embodies many elements of the Asian-American culture. Despite an overreliance on unnecessary, excessive exposition devices (narration, flashbacks, foreshadowing), the story behind all the tales and legends never loses interest. From the breaking of stereotypes to a remarkable depiction of their culture, most Asian viewers will certainly love this film, even more than I do. Phase Four is off to a remarkable start...""Rating: A-"
"It's so extremely generic and made with no passion or soul in it. It's just another super generic origin story where main character is basically invincible and beats the bad guy and saves the day, so he could later join some Endgame style movie."
"One of the best origin MCU films. Good story, great and complex family relationships, with it's own identity, a very good balance between action and comedy and really good fight scenes. Between Simu Liu, Awkwafina and Tony Leung it's difficult to decide which was the best, but the acting was really strong all around (also a mention to Ben Kingsley, always funny!). The best thing I can say about it is that for most of it's duration it didn't even feel like an MCU film.The negatives? Again, too much CGI. It's a huge problem with Marvel and Disney as they use the green screen in almost every scene. I like CGI but seriously, some scenes would look much better with practical effects, others would look way better if they just were shot at location."
"This is one of the MCUs finest movie.The VFXs are the best, the story is the best and the Direction...Amazing direction.The movie is full of adventure. A Must Watch !!"
"The reason I like this movie so much is because the movie is very easy to understand. The jokes were fine, the cgi was amazing. And it's different than most marvel movies. And Simu Liu is an amazing actor and played the role amazingly."
"Overall: 91/100This is more geared towards non-Marvel people than for the Marvel people.Quick & Dirty: I loved it and would highly recommend seeing this film in theatres. Visually stunning, fantastic fight scenes, great story, and emotionally driven. Due to one too many lulls perhaps a slight bit too long in length, but overall, very enjoyable.When I was teen I loved watching Asian films such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""House of Flying Daggers"", & ""Ong-Bak"". This film had the great martial arts fighting sequences that the aforementioned films had. I felt like I was a kid again enjoying something fresh and new. I also fully enjoyed the combination of Mandarin (apologies if that's wrong) and English. A movie with subtitles always reminds me that there's more than the bubble of North American film.The acting was great. Michelle Yeoh was the one who stole the show for me at the end of the day. Again, it reminded of the good old days of martial arts movies that depended on the actors to make things believable instead of lots of CGI.I watch virtually zero Marvel movies and so if you're iffy on whether to watch this or not it shouldn't stop you from enjoying this film. It's funny, action packed, and does not appear to be culturally inappropriate. The acting is great and the length of the film, while a little long, is still exceptional.PS... there are two after the credits scenes so make sure you have time sit until the very end.Enjoy the show!"
This movie surprised me in a good way! I was expecting it to be a flop but it was honestly GREAT! The action and storyline all together made it! Marvel did a really good job with this one and met all expectations.
Good in certain moments. And those moments were very few.
"The story is just not there! The acting was ok, the fighting scenes kinda meh but ok, but the story.. they messed up really bad! Really a bad bad movie from Marvel. Holding hands with Thor 2 and Captain Marvel.. the other reviews were definitely bought."
"Not worth watching or wasting your money on it. Some obvious fanboys are trying to hype it up, but it's not that good. If you like actual Martial Arts movies, i would recommend some older stuff from 70s."
One of the best action movies till date.One advice to DC fans: Stay away from giving negative rating out of jealousy. If you hate Marvel so much then stick to your DC comics and movies. Avoid giving false reviews and ratings to Marvel movies.It's not gonna bring Marvel down.
"I won't say believe on my review ...but just watch it once . It will worth your money and time . This movie has every thing you wanted to see in an origin movie
1) Really strong main villain
2) Awesome secondary villains
3) Nice Back story
4) 5 Star fighting scene and VFX
5) Villains from phase 1 and 2of iron man andnhulk
6) Magic and mystic , humor and emotion at right proportion
Chery on top of cake = Post credit and mid credit."
"A Marvel Legend has risen and it only took 40 years to become an overnight sensation.""Kim's Convenience"" star Simu Liu breathes life into the title character who's changed his birth name to Shaun.What a stretch when you don't want to be found by your estranged dad, Xu Wenwu otherwise known as The Mandarin, played by Tony Chiu-Wai Leung (in his first American film) who has more rings than Ringo Starr or the Olympics.What can I say this guy loves his bling.Rapper/Actor Awkwafina is his BFF, Katy.Together Shaun goes out of his way to avoid bringing back the dead with his wisecracking ""Crazy Rich Asian"" girlfriend in tow.Simu was so intent of getting this gig that back in 2018 he tweeted Marvel for the role.Kung Fu fans are in for a solid 2 hour plus fight spectacular, which doesn't stop too long to draw breath.This movie never gets boring.It's Action, Adventure and Fantasy all rolled into one thrill ride straight out of the Marvel Universe.I kind of half expected 80's Singer, Limahl to crank out ""Never Ending Story"" in the final act of this epic movie thanks to one of the legendary creatures hiding out in a mythical village not unlike Shangri-La from 1937's classic ""Lost Horizon"".Car maker BMW clearly have a product placement deal with Producer, Kevin Feige.They are driven, crushed or smashed in every automobile scene.Hawaiian Director, Destiny Daniel Cretton, best known for ""Just Mercy"" and ""The Glass Castle"" does a marvellous job with the Screen Play and Screen Story he helped write based on the source material from Marvel Comics Steve Engelhart and Jim Starlin.This movie idea has been floating around since the 80's when the late Stan Lee wanted Bruce Lee's son, Brandon to play the lead, but that plan fell through.Australia actually played a huge part in this movie finally being produced despite World War C's best attempt in 2020 to shut down production.Watch out for: Michelle Yeoh plus Aussies Ronnie Chieng, Lynette Curran and Lydia Sarks (from the Toyota Commercials) as the hilarious Flight Attendant.Like all good Marvel movies there is an Easter Egg worth waiting for before the cinema lights come on and the curtains close on the big screen.And just like the movie this review doesn't mention the title till the final frame, ""Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"".Do yourself a favour and take the family to see the 25th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe which is full of surprises and cameos.MCU's first with an Asian leading Superhero Protagonist!"
"Made an account just to write this review. By far one of the best MCU movies so far. Amazing action, cinematography, and acting, combined with one of the best origin stories in recent superhero cinema.GO WATCH IT!!! You won't regret it."
Without a doubt the best action sequences in a marvel film and the best action scenes too. One of the best marvel films also. A great story and great acting. Loved this film.
The action definitely carried this movie. The fight scenes are great. But the writing is a bit weak and the final fight (between the monsters) was kind of boring. Overall it's good fun and the best piece of Marvel entertainment since Endgame.
"I loved the aesthetics of the movie, the score, the acting, the story. One of the strongest marvel films I've seen in a long time."
The marvel universe has excelled here .. pure pure brilliance ! So good !
"Throw your expectations based on the marketing and promotional material away. This movie is fantastic. Yes, it is focused on the asian culture. No, it is not forced. It actually is beautiful.The fighting choreography is fantastic. You like martial arts movies or martial arts in general? Go see this one.The music is great. The humour is great. Actors are cool. Ben Kingsley has a great cameo. The story is cool. The ten rings will blow your mind. TWO post credit scenes that will blow your mind and a great soundtrack.Where Black Widow felt like another movie of the same Marvel formula, this movie has some great surprises and worlds that are fun to explore.Oh, go see it in theaters and don't wait for it to arrive on Disney Plus if you have the option to do that. The visuals are stunning.9/10."
This film breaks the Marvel mold with its action and fantasy aspects. You can't prepare for what you'll see on screen. Just fantastic in every way.
"From my opinion it's a very good and amazing start for the new phase and it's also considered as the real start,and the movie is better than black widow and spider man far from home,also the movie makes us very happy and can't wait the movies that are going to be released like eternals, and spider man no way home.To conclude,the movie is a very good start for the new phase, big applause for the visual effects and cgi team,and I hope the new movies or the coming soon movies to be better and better."
"I was going in with not much fate in this movie, but i got proven wrong. Its something quite fresh and unexpected, some scenes in the first 45 minutes are a bit weak and could be preformed better, the last hour or so is the absolute best. (they could've gone into more details of the rings themselves and they might want to rethink the cast next time) The music on the other hand was okay it was the final battle where the music stood out. The cameos are crazy! I have to give full points to the hair and makeup department and the costume designs, the costumes where awesome! The movie doesn't try hard to be the best...and it doesn't need to because its already pretty good by itself!Marvel did it again!"
"Movie was amazing!! The best movie in mcu, better than endgame. Jorge Es mierda."
"Film is great overrall, same story we all know but the way it told is engaging and emotional, first thing i loved in this movie is action sequence, every action scene is so damn good. The soundtrack is amazing. The characters are well written, even a smaller role is kinda memorable, vfx is great but not in high standards in final climax, its not that messy but notable, there are two credits scenes dont miss that. It does what it meant to do(entertainment). Cant wait for further mcu movies."
"Tony Leung and Fala Chen was the standouts in this movie (in my own humble opinion). Something about their performances struck a chord with me and those two really got me into this movieThe movie is a fun action/fantasy ride, some cool shots and set pieces but it also suffers from those boring PG-13 fights most of the time, it got kind of gritty at some parts which was very welcome.Simu Liu and Awkwafinas relationship felt a little ""manufactured"" at first like there was no chemistry there but it got better as the movie went along, maybe their first scenes together were among the first being shot?The CGI was not the best, at some places it was painfully obvious where they've added CG when you kind of didn't need it and a practical effect or prop could have been used and that is something the MCU doesn't do too well overall.Another thing I really, really liked was the fact that there was more chinese spoken than I anticipated, that always ruins movies/shows/games when everyone speaks English to one another (even if they are in this case Chinese or whatever the setting may be).But, despite the fact that there was more Chinese spoken than I anticipated there was also a whole lot of English spoken solely between characters that aren't native English speakers. For example between Shang-Chi and Wenwu during their final fight, it's just those two no Americans or other around."
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a visual masterpiece: Marvel not only made a very beautiful picture, but also finally worked on staging the battles!The film is very original. While watching, you dive as much as possible into Chinese culture, enjoy the mythical animals and completely forget that you are watching a movie of the MCU, remembering this only when you hear a reference or see a cameo of a character you know.As for the plot, it is very simple, straightforward and without a single plot twist. Purely a fairy tale.The humor is good overall, apart from a couple of Katie's little jokes.And Shang-Chi himself turned out to be a little faded, lost against the background of everything that was happening. But he has potential.Two post-credits scenes, one of which will amuse you a lot!8/10."
Imagine a movie with well timed jokes and action pacing sequences crossed with the magical world of Asian mythology and Kung Fu and you got Shang-Chi. 10/10.
"Shang-Chi did just about everything right. It really was the Mulan that the live action Mulan tried to be and should have been.It had comedy, suspense, amazing martial arts, female heroines and of course a dragon.I went into this not expecting to like it but I was pleasantly surprised.If they only gotten Henry Golding a role, the movie would have been a 10."
Amazing personality. Amazing personality. Amazing personality. Character is not very funny. I love the character. I love Marvel and the heroes. Thanks Marvel.
I was going in expecting the film to be decent. But it's better than I thought. The film is unbelievably good and exciting!! A lot of culture and amazing martial arts. A must see film!
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the latest comic-book inspired action-fantasy film from Marvel-Disney Studios. Daniel Destin Crettin is the director.The film stars Simu Liu (Canadian television's ""Kim's Convenience"") as the title character. Known as Shaun in the beginning of the narrative, he's a late-20-something who works as a valet at a San Francisco hotel with his carefree best friend Katy (Nora ""Awkwafina"" Lum). Seemingly okay with eking by earning a working-class living, Shaun's life changes when he receives a mysterious postcard. The next day a group of hitmen attack him on a bus, forcing him to reveal his potent martial arts prowess.Turns out, ""Shaun"" was born to Wenwu (veteran Chinese cinema star Tony Leung), a crime boss in China whose career has literally lasted centuries, thanks to a mysterious set of rings worn around his lower arms that grant magic powers-- including, apparently, immortality. Shang Chi's mother Ying Li (Fala Chen) was a resident of a mysterious, magical Chinese city-- think Shangri-La or Black Panther's Wakanda. Possessing her own magic-inspired martial arts skills, she convinced Wenwu to temporarily leave behind his crime empire and start a family. It didn't last, leading to a family tragedy and Shang's self-imposed exile in America.The plot has to do with Wenwu's insistence on bringing Shang and his sister Xialing (Menger Zhang) back into the family fold, so they can collectively find the entrance to the mystic city, conquer the inhabitants and reunite with Ying Li, who Wenwu insists whispers to him from beyond the grave. Shang and Xialing want nothing to do with their father's criminal empire, but Wenwu is not above brutality to convince cooperation.The film takes dramatic liberties with the original source material. Part of this is legally necessary, as the comic book Shang Chi's father was originally Yellow Peril villain Fu Manchu-- officially owned by the Sax Rohmer estate. Additionally, the original comics posed Shang as an agent of Great Britain's MI-6, with a mostly British supporting cast, including someone who ""playfully"" would refer to Shang as (an ethnic slur for Chinese/Asians). All of that backdrop is wisely eschewed for an all new set of allies and adversaries. Katy provides comic relief and as a low-key audience stand-in. As a 2nd-generation child of immigrants she also highlights the vantage point of someone who is very ""Americanized"" who bristles at ""old school values and customs"" of her parents/grandparents but striggles to fulfill her own pathway in life.Simu Liu gives a solid journeyman's performance as Shang Chi. He handles the action as well as the dramatic and comedic components. Still, it's something of a role that's semi-mired in exposition, because viewers mainly get to see his younger life in flashbacks.The action is well choreographed, including ballet-like scenes of combat and courtship alike, with nods to fantasy physics but never egregiously outlandish. The film also has beautiful cinematography courtesy of Bill Pope (his cinematography credits include 'The Matrix' and the first three 'Spider-Man' films).Possibly the most fully realized performance is that of Tony Leung, who gets to portray a more in-depth villain than is typically featured in most comic book movies. There are other solid supporting roles played by Michelle Yeoh and Sir Ben Kingsley.The climax of the film is filled with special-effects-based wonders including creatures of all sorts and Mulan-style fights between army legions. This can get dizzying for the non-comics-steeped layperson, so this may be overwhelming for some viewers. But the overall narrative is satisfying.The film takes place independent of any particular goings-in in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it is only a post-credits coda that links it to the greater Marvel pantheon. This film can be enjoyed by itself without watching any of the ""Avengers"" franchises.It remains to be seen whether ""Legend of the Ten Rings"" makes the Shang Chi character a household name alongside Captain America, Iron Man and the Rest but it is more than a worthy entry to the current phase of the Marvel movie saga."
"The charm of this movie comes from the setting of the main characters, showing a reflection of today's world, where Asian culture and the way of life in the west creates an environment of searching for one's own identity and place - this is where we meet Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) first. A young adult trying to navigate through his life far away from his family in the city of San Francisco. His partner in crime is his best female friend Katy (Awkwafina).Simu Liu's character arc in this film is not significant. Although he makes
a solid protagonist, his own character development is de minimis. Awkwafina, by contrast, steals the film as the ordinary person caught up in the epic power struggle. Her trademark zingers and bemused quips make her the perfect foil against the escapist superhero world that she- and we as the audience- are thrust into. Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) is a subtly effective Marvel villain with a compelling family backstory; he is a cinematic antagonist with the most idealism and righteous sense of purpose since Bill the Butcher in ""Gangs of New York"".Michelle Yeoh as Shang-Chi's aunt Jiang Nan has again some great fighting scenes which stand up to her wonderful performance in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Overall this movie has great fighting scenes, extraordinary effects, especially the flying dragons which are delightful to watch. Highly recommended for everyone who likes superheroes and a touch of mysterious fairytales."
Enjoyed every action scene. Must watch in big screens.
"PART WITH NO SPOILERS
This film was absolutely amazing! Almost every aspect of the film was perfect and it smashed my expectations and took it's place as one of the best Marvel films, or any films that I have seen.The visual effects in this movie were fabulous, there were plenty of captivating scenes with astounding usage of modern technology. The cinematography was probably one of the best I have seen in a film for a while, it kept you captivated and on your toes the entire time! I also noticed light being used to make the scenes even more captivating, which is something you don't always see in films.The dialogue was solid and didn't feel clunky or wierd, the jokes were well spaced and gave your muscles a rest from being tensed.The action was perfectly filmed and beautiful, it felt like they were dancing. The choreography was very impressive.The story itself was nothing unexpected, pretty much a generic origin story, but don't worry that doesn't take away from the film at all!And lastly the villain was for me one of the most interesting aspects of the film, they made you feel for him and gave him an interesting charachter with a non-generic motive, I haven't felt for a villain this much for a long while.PS: There are two post credit scenes so stay after the credits.PART WITH SPOILERS
And I just wanted to say I loved the return of Trevvor Slattery! It was such a surprise and something they managed to keep out of the trailers, he was hilarious especially where he played dead. Also I like the fact Wong played a role in the film, the scenes with him were interesting. The post credit scenes set up the sequel which I will be very interested to see! Can't wait to find out what the sister does and who the rings are calling."
"An incredible MCU film. It offers nothing too cerebral, but that is not the main focus of the film. The comedy, the action, the themes, the choreography and the vibrant visuals make this film a standout among similar standalone Marvel films, while the layered and truly epic soundtrack is the finishing touch. While some of the effects and the pacing perhaps could have been a little more polished, and the final battle had some weaknesses, this is a colourful, emotional and fun rollercoaster of a film. Tony Leung is by far the standout member of the cast, delivering a captivating and even sympathetic villain. Simu Liu holds his own, but needs more time to really shine as a new Marvel superhero-while Meng'er Zhang, Awkwafina and Fala Chen are integral to this film's effectiveness. Overall, this fun and touching movie is an exemplar of the 'Marvel formula' and its strengths."
"An Absolut entertainment. Funny, emotional, action packed. Acting is good direction editing very very good, other techniqualities are good... al last a powerful origin story."
It was such a awesome movie!!!!!!!!! I want to thanks Marvel.
"Marvel has started its new era, which will be interesting for their old fans and will attract the attention of new audience. The film's director, Deston Creton, did a good job. Perfectly selected cast of actors who have done their tasks for 100%. They understand their characters and clearly convey their emotions. Gorgeous costumes and Joel West's soundtracks, with Chinese motives, aptly create an atmosphere of a magical world we haven't seen before. I won't say anything bad about the script either. I didn't mantion any plot holes, and the bonus was good jokes and a touching and sometimes tragic family story. Bill Pope's balanced shots and amazing special effects, which have definitely reached a new level, also go to the film's pluses. A special tribute to the director of the fights Andy Chang. Clear movements and dynamic music make such scenes a real spectacle. This film is worth your attention.My rating is 8.5 / 10."
"Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot. The Asian style and presentation is beautiful, showing off plenty of folklore and style in both modern and traditional settings. The presentation is very stylish, the special effects were superb and the martial arts fight scenes were fast and exciting
The plot is good, focusing on the human and family side of the characters rather than the magical, and sets up a good intrigue for the continuation of the MCU. The acting is good and although the comic relief and cute character did change things up, they also spoiled it a bit and made the slow middle section drag on even more. The ending was pretty grand and epic, but I felt it could have been better."
"I was worried this movie would be a bust but it was SO much better than Black Widow AND had some great fight scenes. Though it's not my favorite Marvel movie of all time (I am a huge Marvel fan), I found it to be a decent action movie and a pretty good plot for a Marvel origin story.Tony (The Mandarin) was freaking AMAZING, some of the best acting I've seen in a Marvel movie and by far the best actor in the movie. Akwafina surprised me as I thought she was an odd casting choice but her and Simu had great on chemistry on set. Also shout out to WONG the OG Asian marvel superhero.Definitely see this movie!!!!!"
Marvel make a awesome file in the 2021 And thier stories of the character are so deep and the VFX was just wow I love this movie.
"Shang Chi and the Legend of the 10 Rings delivers a majestic adrenaline filled experience, incorporating the perfect formula to a Marvel film ( Great plot, action, comical relief, and flirting with a love interest). All of which are displayed effectively. There was never a dull moment. This is one of the better origin stories within the Marvel universe while giving us a different cultural approach. Be prepared to see a couple of cameos from some hard hitting Marvel characters.VerdictL Marvel fans this one is for you! If you love action that is displayed beautifully then this is the movie for you! Go to the theaters to watch this one!"
Amazing. My favorite marvel movie so far. Great choreography and acting. Perfect cast and non stop fun.
"Bringing martial arts into this franchise is well.... a breath of fresh air from Marvel. Showcasing a series of excellent action sequences. There are some very intelligent minds be hide this origin story fantasy sci-fi feature. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the best MCU films. Pro-tip, at some point in your lives seek this gem out ! This is going to be very solid UHD HDR blu-ray and the 3D is very impressive albeit some minor cross-talk but forgivable as the are some very intricate set pieces for the left and right eye to navigate via the post conversion 3D. Very well done over all.The visuals were absolutely stunning, comedic relief was always on point, fight sequences were sleek yet powerful. The story arch is well paced and unfolds gradually so one can get emotionally involved with the films characters , the acting is superb on all fronts from the films talented ensemble . The directing and pacing is spot on.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and one of my favorite entries as a whole. You'll leave the theater satisfied."
A solid origin story of marvel's shang chi loved it completely don't know what's wrong with the bad reviews I guess dc fans are super sad that even shang chi over shadowed their only hope this year let's face it the suicide squad is not going to be the best movie this year in fact it's overrated in opinion.
Even Mortal Kombat 1995 has better fighting scenes. Not recommending.
"Shang Chi is a completely action-packed movie, from start to end. Sure, the story was predictable with a meek narrative, but those gaps were filled with 2 hours of crazy action. The action sequences and cinematography in itself were quite impressive, considering a good portion of the movie showed sequences without any super powers. Its a good watch!"
"When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time. Along the way, unknown properties like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms. I was really hoping that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings would follow in those footsteps, and it more than does. With rich world-building, a great cast, and the use of mythology, this is one of my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to date. Over time I may even come to appreciate it even more. After a first viewing, here's why Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings deserves to be seen on the big screen (if you can).After being trained as an assassin by his father, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is given ten years of freedom from this life. In the present, the film picks up with Shang-Chi (Shaun) as he is living a normal life in San Francisco with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the history/mythology of the so-called Ten Rings is brought back into the forefront, his mission is to go and find his father. With the help of his friend and sister, they return home to face the music and it may just end up being father vs son to save this world. From start to finish, this film delves into the fun, the mythological, the family drama, and some incredible martial arts in order to tell this very solid story.Aside from the fact that newcomer Simu Liu is undeniably charming and very likeable in this role, it's the unique style of the movie that made it stand out from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, it still has the same look and feel, especially when it comes to aesthetics and comedic relief, but the rest of the film had its own distinct heartbeat. Bringing martial arts into this franchise just felt like a breath of fresh air to me. Not only does it feel simultaneous that they're trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature, but the fact that martial arts, mixed with actual god-like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film. Without giving anything away, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is far more magical and mystical than I was expecting, but I kind of loved the finale when looking back on it.There's really not much about this film that I feel compelled to complain about, but I will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology, sometimes the comedy felt out of place. Awkwafina as Katy was great and I think her chemistry with Simu Liu was great as well, but I think certain cuts to her one-liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation. There are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention, but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier. Aside from the humour taking me out a few times, this film is just a blast.Overall, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole. Director Destin Daniel Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) has done a great job here and the cinematography by Bill Pope (The Matrix, Baby Driver) was also a real standout. I thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that's absolutely in part to how it was filmed. I almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative, but again, after thinking about the movie again, there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned, even if a tad overblown. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a must-see, but even if you're not, this one can stand on its own as well, having only a few acknowledgements to previous films.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is now playing exclusively in theatres and if you're able to go in your area, I highly recommend it."
Loved the fight sequences and I was blown away in the second half of the movie .. It's like on another level! Phenomenal.
"Lovely plot, great characters, awesome designs & costumes. As a martial artist fan I loved the fight choreography & stunts. They felt fresh and authentic.The mix between Martial Arts, Action, Fantasy & Drama was great. I was worried about the movie, when I watched the trailer. The CGI effects were amazing. Just felt like it didn't needed it. The movie got its own marvel flavor, when the cgi scenes took over.I had a lot of fun during watching. Specially the fighting scenes, action scenes and with a lovely humor.The acting was fantastic. Shang-Chi's character development was great just overshadowed by his fathers character in my opinion, cause the story of his father was somehow more interesting. The chemistry between Shang-Chi & Katy was the icing on the cake. So lovely and perfectly matches into the movie.This is the first Hollywood movie for Tony Leung. He did an amazing job.I think it's safe to say they did well to represent Asian culture on a big movie screen. I highly recommend this to every marvel fan. They did an outstanding job."
"The MCU has definitely reached its highest level as far as special effects are concerned, a really good job."
"A super smooth blend of magic, martial arts and mythology. The chemistry between the two leads is spot on and it's hilarious. Some of the best choreographey in the MCU and a really memorable villain. If you want the full experience, watch in a cinema and I'd personally recommend watching Iron Man 3 first."
"As an Asian, this movie hit me in the feels hard...All the cast and team members did a stupendous job from visual effects to martial arts action. What else to expect from Marvel? Best movie of 2021 so far. üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè"
"This movie is awesome, i can't say one bad thing about it, the choreography is good, the writing is good, the.antagonist is good, everything is good!"
"Action packed and adventurous, a must-see. I look forward to seeing more of their stories and how they'll fit into the Marvel universe with other heroes."
"Go an watch this movie in theaters.. the story,effects,action, comedy,acting everything are awesome. PS : and you will get 2 post credit scenes."
Tbh I really didn't have a lot of expectations going into this movie because I was disappointed with the stereotype multiple times but hell yea I absolutely LOVED this movie! (especially Hong Kong films martial arts prototype and the other fight choreography)I have no doubt to these actor since I know them all (Awkwafina's role could be better). They did put a lot of effort into mythology although it's a bit weird. Well done marvel!
"I went in not knowing much about Shang-Chi or the ten rings for that matter. I wasn't expecting much but I was wrong, and I am glad I was. Great story, great cast and probably one of the best Marvel films done so far. Recommend taking the time out to see it if you are a fan of marvel/comic book movies/heroes."
"Marvel Origins story are amazing but this one breaks the line. The writing, the humor, the comedy everything is perfect here. The directors made all the best choices which made the movie incredible."
"A very welcomed addition to the MCU, and any Avengers to come. 'Shang-Chi' kung-fu's it's way to top tier MCU territory, especially when it comes to origin stories.Perhaps this generations 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', both of which are visual spectacles to behold. 'Shang-Chi' is full of beautiful creatures, costumes, martial arts, and acting. Probably the best fighting in the MCU, which makes sense (though Cap and Winter Soldier fighting is my personal favourite). The real Mandarin makes his debut and does not disappoint, Tony Chiu-Wai Leung was fantastic. All the other cast members were very likable as well. A few appearances from other MCU characters, including a surprising one that somewhat redeems himself.A refreshing Marvel superhero movie in that it primarily focuses on itself, but has tons of potential to jump right in with other Marvel storylines. The MCU still holds lots of excitement for the future with characters like Shang-Chi."
"I absolutely loved the first Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, but since then, most of the movies have just fell flat for me. Shang-Chi on the other hand is exactly what I'd be hoping for. No overly complicated story lines with too many plot holes to count. This has great character development with people you actually feel sympathy for. Natural comedic relief throughout. Amazing fight scenes and fairly constant action without feeling forced. This is just a great super hero movie all around."
"I am so glad theatres are open where I live and what a visual treat this movie is, from the characters to the battles and everything, This movies is a must watch in theatres (sorry for bad English)"
"Tony, Fala and Simu had an absolutely phenomenal performance in this fantastic movie. It's so nice to see more representation of different cultures. This movie did for the Asian community what Black Panther did for the African American community.The action scenes were one of the best of the ANY marvel movie. The choreography was by far the best in any Marvel movie. This movie felt like Ip Man with a mythical story added to it. The action was impeccable. The story was unique and wasn't very generic. I love that Simu does his own stunts too.Marvel NEVER ceases to amaze me. We need more company like this *cough cough Warner Bros and Sony cough cough*So thankful we're getting two more!"
The ACTORS of this action film did NOT disappoint! I knew if it had Tony Chiu-Wai Leung and Michelle Yeoh it was going to be good! Simu Liu and Awkwafina were fantastic! They kept it traditional but also added a little modern flare to this kung-fu movie. Must see this movie IN THE THEATRE AND NOT SITTING ON YOUR COUCH!
"It was great to see one of the many MCU martial artist in live action and actually living up to their comic character (Iron Fist Netflix series blows btw). The fight scenes were fantastic along with the other action sequences. Most of the characters were easy to sympathize with and the cameos were great.The only thing I personally felt that didn't go over very well was Aquifina's performance and comedic lines. It felt a little flat and I thought Ben Kingsley was way more funny than her. If it wasn't for the fact she shot the evil soul sucker in the throat saving Shang Chi and his sister, you could have left her out or played her character without all of the comedic misses and it would have been fine.As mentioned however my son and liked the movie and it provided a nice lead in to the next big bad guy of the MCU (maybe Mephisto?). Definitely worth a watch in opinion."
"Good work. Lots of money was given to the right people to create the right movie. From choreography, to story, to cinematography, nothing disappointed. Top 5 marvel movie for me HANDS DOWN."
"I thought I'd like the film, but I didn't expect it to be one of my all-time favorite MCU movies! It's a mix of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and anything Jackie Chan. The action in this movie is as good as you've read, and easily the best action in any MCU film to date. Simu Liu is awesome, but the ending is so epic it's definitely worth the price of admission. As an English teacher I loved the self-aware reference to Macbeth, but the film does a fantastic job completing the hero's journey. Great job Marvel, you've done it yet again."
I loved it !But it didn't quite feel like a marvel movie ....
"Beautiful from start to finish. Amazing visuals, CGI and fight scenes. Acting was incredible, Tony Leung was so compelling as a villain. And so refreshingly funny too.Best Marvel Origin story yet."
"The movie provides an excellent experience for the whole family. One of the best, if not the best, origin stories in the MCU. Amazing cameos and mind-blowing action. This one is for any die-hard marvel lover or action seeker. The Actors produced some of the best on-screen performances we have ever seen in an MCU movie. Keep up the excellent work exciting times head for the super hero movie lovers."
"Serviceable. That's the word that came to my mind as I left the theatre. Not sure if that's a great pull-quote for the BluRay release, but it'd be mine.Don't get me wrong, I liked this. I had fun and found few things, if at all, that I disliked. But since this is basically Black Panther Jr, it made me appreciate Chadwick Boseman's Similar Origin Story WAAAY more.I had to think about that when I got out of this. Why did I suddenly think the average rating I gave to Black Panther was better than this and then it hit me: Simu Liu can't act nor does he have charisma. Chadwick Boseman on the other hand, had both talents IN SPADES.In fact, Black Panther's entire cast, including the villain, had both: better acting and 100x more charisma. But, again, the actors here gave it their all. No one was bad necessarily, well except for the lead.Meek valet driver Shaun gets attacked on his San Francisco bus commute to work and unbelievably fights back leading to his BFF & world via viral video knowing this mild-mannered passenger is anything but. So, off he goes to save his sister he believes is in danger from their evil dad. And a place in the world, and Avengers, he will find.I know the lead actor/title character from a TV show I just discovered: Kim's Convenience. Yes, Simu Liu's drop-dead gorgeous, but I never really got the impression he was a great actor on the show. I'd hope with a big screen movie he had to carry on his shoulders he'd suddenly show his depth. Nope. If anything, I know less of his talent than I did with the 1st season of his show I've seen so far.Now, his costars? Another story. I loved his Dad played by Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, definitely his BFF Katy by Awkwafina and I'll always love Michelle Yeoh, Ronny Chieng, Benedict Wong and the one who stole the whole movie and my favorite character: Trevor Slattery. (Don't look him up if you don't know who he is. Just take my word for it: he was the best and funniest character of this movie by a landslide.)And speaking of laughs, normally I don't like when they overload Marvel movies with humor. Both Iron Man 3 and Thor: Ragnarok were 80% comedies, 20% action - which is not the ratio I want my Superhero movies to be. Here, in Shang-Chi, it's toned down a ton and funny when used.The special effects were fine, the pacing was just right, the action was acceptable and I liked the heart shown in the third and best act of the feature. I would recommend it, but it's definitely in the lower half of the 25 MCU movies.Stay for the two end-credit scenes. They actually made them relevant to this movie's plot/Shang-Chi universe.***Final Thoughts: NO SPOILERS, but the best line was from Mr. Liu, himself: ""I'm not Korean!"" he laughs at his own joke. Taken out of context to avoid spoilers, but I wonder if anyone else caught this meaning. He's really Chinese but he plays a Korean in his TV show. I wonder if they threw that in if he ever got slack from his television portrayal. Either way, I thought it was hilarious."
"Love the cinematography, the plot, the cast, the whole idea of this movie is amazing. 100% recommend."
"Having worked on this film's visual effects, I can safely say that I was pleasantly surprised when watching Shang-Chi at the premiere. Up to that point, I had not actually watched the full film.This movie is bolstered by a fantastic performance from Simu Liu, who I hope will star in many other great films. His charisma alone is a good reason to like the movie. The supporting performances weren't quite as memorable, but of course, they were not bad at all. As usual, the visual effects for this film were great (and I might be a tad too self-indulgent here), as was the direction by Destin Daniel Cretton.I am very excited to see where Shang-Chi will show up next!"
So bored! I hardly cared about the characters. Bloated special effects that was style over substance.
"I find this film very engaging from start to finish. I couldn't get my eyes off the screen! The Kung Fu is very good, and the visual effects are wonderful. I enjoyed every second of this film."
"I was amazed by this one !!THE SOUNDTRACKS, THE VISUALS !!Loved everything in the movie.Every moment was so Entertaining , I really enjoyed it."
I really like this movie because this movie had comedy action and they really embraced the Chinese culture and I can't wait to see more of shang chi.
"Going into this the trailers had me excited but i was blown away by seeing it in IMAX opening night. Definitely going again later in the week, it really deserves a rewatch."
"Shang-Chi is 2.5 hours of your life well spent by basking in the glory of a compelling, profound story with absolutely breathtaking visuals. It's so easy to get lost in the majesty of the world that's being portrayed and to feel like this is your life for a short period. That being said, the movie is a double edged sword; not in terms of the movie itself, but rather the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole.Shang-Chi evokes a feeling that I've only experienced from two other Marvel movies: Black Panther and Dr. Strange. After 10+ years, the whole ""America will save the world"" and ""America is the center of everything"" vibe has grown dull. What these three films all have in common is that they do not focus on the ""America first"" mentality that has been the case with MCU films for so long. They make the universe in which these stories are taking place feel so much richer.The movie starts off with something that I cannot recall ever having been done in an MCU film before: dialogue that is not English. The Chinese dialogue with subtitles automatically makes you feel like this is something different, in the best way possible. What's more, there are numerous instances across the film where characters speak Chinese, which makes the experience feel so much more culturally authentic.The fighting scenes are unlike anything seen in any other Marvel movie. There is a fluidity to the characters' movements which feels like dancing. These moments alone make the movie a must see.The special effects are beyond satisfying. The creatures based on Chinese legends look so lifelike that you genuinely feel like they could exist out in nature. The Great Protector in particular is jaw dropping and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time it's on-screen. Furthermore, any moment involving the Ten Rings is pure visual delight.As for the story, a perfect balance is struck between a grounded human experience and an otherworldly mystical journey. The heartfelt family conflict moments are not the kind of cheesy stuff you usually get in a high budget superhero movie. You really feel for what the characters are going through and are genuinely concerned for their well-being. Furthermore, the otherworldly aspect of the story fits in perfectly with the aforementioned conflict. There are a lot of abstract concepts and creatures that wield strong mystical powers, and when you reach the end of the movie you might think to yourself ""I don't really understand everything that I just saw"". However, that's part of the beauty of this movie. It bridges whats familiar and easily understood with stuff that's very unfamiliar and difficult to comprehend, which leaves you both satisfied and full of wonder.For the longtime MCU fans, Wenwu perfectly explains all the references of the Ten Times dating back to Iron Man 1 and how good organization worked. Trevor Slattery also makes an appearance and plays a pretty significant role in the film, which fulfills the longtime wish of Marvel fans to learn about his fate. His humorous role from Iron Man 3 is perfectly preserved, yet he's also given purpose beyond simply being a joke character. The character is ultimately very satisfying and surpassed all expectations.I could keep going on and on about how great this movie is. It's truly a Marvel masterpiece and deserves all the accolades it will inevitably receive."
"Shang-chi, the most disloyal man in MCU: he has 10 rings for 10 wives.Phase 4 continues with a new blockbuster with an all main Asian cast. Having escaped from his father, Shang-chi was forced to face his past and embrace his true self.Is this movie good? The answer should be no, despite how much people overhyped this. However, I did enjoy the fight choreography and beautiful visuals. This honestly doesn't mean a lot, considering that this is a Marvel's project. The cast did an okay job themselves, and some comedic moments land.If you actually take this movie seriously and don't get distracted by all the colors and actions on the screen, it should be clear that this was an overhyped, mediocre at best Marvel movie. It's not bad like Captain Marvel, but it's not good. There is barely any depth to the story. This type of story was done like a gazillion times, and this movie didn't add a lot into the tropes. The progression was formulaic, and you already know what the end would look like from the beginning.Our main character, Shang-chi, again, was typical and bland. The actor wasn't necessarily bad, it's just that the writers didn't try hard enough to make the character more compelling or special. Also, the dude just randomly knew how to crazy stuff near the end, despite never wear the ten rings himself before.Also, in typical Marvel fashion, the phenomenon of ""OH I know that person from somewhere else"" (*insert Leonardo DiCarpio's pointing meme*) was used as another distractor. Sometimes it's good and all, but remember that this made no impact on how good a movie is.Which directs your attention to the post-credit scenes. Again, another overhype train from people. Reality is: they aren't that special.Overall, just calm down people. A mediocre Marvel hero movie. Doesn't mean it's a bad movie. 6.5/10."
It wasn't bad I really liked it. I'm not even a big marvel fan but I really enjoyed this movie.
Really enjoyed the story and the acting was amazing.
"The cinematographie can make this a masterpiece. I just really love the character writing of everyone in this movie , you can easily understand each character because you get to see caused there motivation. And of course the way they used the Chinese language in this movie it fits the movie perfectly and pulls you into the story. Overal a really funny visual pleasing and enjoyable movie."
"I'm a sucker for a good quality martial arts fight scene, and this has many of them. Every one is perfect. The movie has humor, heart, and really amazing fight scenes. I love the visual effects, the tradition and culture of the rich Chinese people, it overall just worked and I'm so excited to go see it for a second time."
"Marvel have churned out hit after hit with the first 3 phases but this feels something different! A great film, great action sequences, good casting, a few surprises and cameos! Looking forward to this character progressing withing the marvel universe!"
"Not only does Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings expand the MCU further and introduce new concepts for the future, but it delivers some badass choreographed action scenes and an emotionally complex villain."
"I didn't know anything about the film before going to see it, I thought it would be like Dr Strange (it wasn't). Beautiful visuals, brilliant action scenes and I was interested in the film the whole time!"
"What I like :1)the action, especially in the first half and the building scene that make me nervous and scared on the characters2) great visuals and good cinematography, colors, cgi was really amazing3)I love the acting4) a good villan that really do everything for a purpose not because he is the bad guy so he acts like that (like the villan of ""black widow"" movie)Now, what I don't like1)like every marvel movie the movie begins strong and introduce the characters then it becomes more slow with good comedy and some action and we go to a journey to the final battle full of cgi fights, OK guys there are some people who love cgi fights but not me, the fight was a bit terrible and predictable (honestly I love the action in this movie but not the final battle)2) the movie is full of emotional scenes but (do I feel anything? No)3) the music was good but not epic and there is no great theme for shang chi (I loved the music and the songs but it wasn't good enough)Overall good action movie with a great action sequences and good comedy and good villan and cinematography and cgi, but it's a *marvel* movie, with cgi final battle and weak ending and a good setup for what comes nextThank you for reading my quick review, this is my opinion, the more important is your opinion and remember not everyone one love the same thing."
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and written in part by Destin Daniel Cretton, the director of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy.The film is about Shaun (Simu Liu), who tries to put his past behind him and just wants to enjoy his life with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the mysterious organization the Ten Rings finds Shaun, he is forced to confront his past after all. To do this, he must take his birth name Shang-Chi again, to protect Katy and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) from the actions of the Ten Rings and their leader Xu WenWu the Mandarin (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who is also Shaun. His father.This film is Marvel's first superhero film starring an Asian actor. Furthermore, with this film they also bring out the Asian culture and fighting styles well. For this they have used other movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as an example. Fans of this film can recognize moments that refer back to these films. They portray the fight scenes where characters fight each other with Asian fighting styles well and entertainingly. The art of the Asian fighting style is somewhat overshadowed when characters use more supernatural powers in the film. Fight scenes where this happens are less exciting and entertaining than scenes where characters fight each other in more normal ways.At one point, the film also feels like you're watching a live-action mix of the Asian animation shows Pok√©mon and Avatar: The Last Airbender. These scenes provide some extra comedy and are especially more entertaining for younger viewers. The movies and costumes of the film cast also help with the emergence of Asian culture in the film. The visual effects are also put to good use in the film. Except for a few scenes, it can be seen that they have used a green screen for the background, but fortunately this is not disturbing in the film. Creatures can also be returned before the start of the film. A bit redundant on a few action scenes with 3D effects in the film.The acting is well done by the film cast. Simu Liu took to Twitter to ask Marvel to play the part, with both parties quickly making a good deal. Simu Liu comes across as good and charismatic as the lead of the film and further conveys the action sequences beautifully. Along with Awkwafina, he also has good chemistry in the film and together provide good appropriate humor. The comedy also doesn't overshadow all the dramatic aspects in the film, which sometimes does happen. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung also portrays the villain of the film in a good and sympathetic way, so that as a viewer you understand why he does what he is doing to me. This film is also only his first English-language role in an American film. Although this is only his first time, he still delivers good and appropriate acting. Meng'er Zhang does not get that much time in the film, but a bit less good or present in the film."
"This could have been a great movie, but it wasn't. It began well and ended well. Everything in between was pretty lame. Disney has the Disney plus platform where they could have built up this character since no one really knows who shang chi is. Unfortunately, Disney didn't do that so most of the minute I'm just left wondering why do I care. With so much Asian culture to pull from I wish Disney would have done more. 3 out of 10 stars. Other reviews I'm sure are paid for."
"I Saw this today at the BFI London IMAX with my 14 year old and his friend and we all enjoyed this immensely! Its thrilling & races along at a great pace from the first scene! It is the perfect mix of Action Fantasy & lighthearted comedy with a decent story line to bind it all together, one could say another typical Marvel movie churned out of their factory production line, however, I felt that this one really is miles better than so many of the recent ones due to the incredible martial arts fight scenes, they are so fast it's really exciting to watch. I also enjoyed the fact that I didn't recognise any of the main actors other than Ben Kingsley (who is hilarious) this often makes a movie much easier to get into than when it's the same old super star faces. No hesitation to recommend - great for the kids AND the adults too."
"Well here's my review. After just reading the reviews on here I came across some bad reviews and laughed at them. Most of them are saying the villain was bad (not a spoiler: his dad) or they are saying it doesn't fit in the new marvel universe. I also saw one review who gave a 1/10 and said it was because of one of the actors in the post credits scene. For the people who are reviewing bad reviews don't like a new superheroes being Asian.The movie was a perfect it made you feel sorrow for the character and the position he was in between his father. You could feel the weight he had on his shoulders. The beginning of the movie starts with the fear of unknown, you don't know who is after him. You go through many happy and sad emotions. The movie also did a excellent job using the characters native language. The fight scenes are astonishing and the cgi was beautiful. The wasn't any cgi characters that didn't look real. The cast and crew should be proud of a beautiful masterpiece they made. Amazing amazing!"
"I was really looking forward to this film, and was excited to see shang chi in the MCU. It started out good with an interesting father, and son character development. As the film continued, it seemed to rely very heavily on the CGI. After a while all the CGI felt bloated and overwhelming. The acting was well done, by everyone in the film no weak links. Was hoping this film, would have had a more grounded plot like Iron Man."
The movie was awesome and very inspiring to all marvel fans . Akwafina was absolutely hilarious and a great fighter . Shang chi is about to join the avengers for the first time after endgame. I have this feeling Shang chi and doctor strange will have to travel through time and space to Find all places that he's never seen before. I hope to see Shang chi travel to New York City or meet guardians of the galaxy and captain marvel and find some connections to the mcu .
"The first third was really enjoyable, excellent pacing, well timed jokes and incredible hand-to-hand-combat scenes. I already thought about seeing it a second time but the rest of the movie had a completely different feel to it. The second part for me was a drastic change (basically after the group is captured). Awkwafina, who was good in the beginning began to annoy with too many jokes and goofy moments and she did feel quite out of place which continued for the rest of the movie. The OG Mandarin appearing was a nice callback but he as well felt way too goofy and is just a cheap comic relief without actual importance to the story. You could probably cut 30min or so of less imports scenes without hurting continuity of the film. The final part was surprisingly different than any other MCU final but still came of as underwhelming to me because I really didn't need another CGI monster fight (although Shang-Chi's dragon looked good) and all in all the whole ending was a bit too much of everything. First you got the village fighting the Ten Rings while Shaun begins to fight his dad (this fight goes on for quite a while and could have easily been the end fight) who later opens a gate which leads to more fighting between humans and monsters and monsters and other creatures - you get what I'm trying to say. At some point you just want closure and as I already said, this final part really drags.Sadly some parts of the movie looked way more immersive than others and what also took away some fun for me were the trailers that showed way too much of the movie which takes away a lot of excitement (e.g. Abomination scene). It almost reminded me of some old MCU trailers where they basically showed the whole movie.The music did remind me a bit of Black Panther since it's a mixture of classical/culturally inspired music and modern pop songs, I definitely enjoyed it.Overall Shang-Chi is still a good movie to watch because it has some talented new actors playing interesting new characters (I really liked Razorfist), a brilliant fight choreography and some cool set-pieces. Sadly it's clever and quick beginning forces the last hour +/- to feel kinda slow and unbalanced while the ending is a thing of personal preference. I still think you can enjoy the whole thing if you know what you're going into. The post-/end credit scenes are also great."
I really enjoyed the film. I thought that it was emotional just as it was funny and will most likely see again!
"Black widow was a really good movie, but this is what marvel is all about! Amazing storyline, phenomenal action, and just the right amount of humor. This movie was an epic introduction to a character that I was previously unfamiliar with. The future is bright in the MCU."
"I wasn't expecting much when I first heard about it, but the storyline is one of a kind and I definitely enjoyed the fight scenes."
"The movie was phenomenal in a 4DX theater. The fight scenes in the movie felt real and close to Hong Kong fighting movies. The story behind Shang-Chi is set up through his father, which is unique through the MCU."
Great movie with awesome acting and stunts. Good jokes throughout the movie aswell. The story was awesome and im definitely looking forward to the future of the MCU.
"Very great choreography, every fight tells a great story and the movie grabs your attention and doesn't let go. Only reason that this isn't 5 stars is that the final act did what Black Panther did, became too superheroy and got distracted by CGI battles rather than getting into a great family battle between father and son. Still other than that the movie was fantastic and more people need to go see and support this film!"
"Compared to other action/kung fu movies, I think there's more impressive than those fights but even then; it still works. They well introduced martial arts and 10 rings and I'm impressed of how they use it in fights but I kinda want to see the unique powers of each rings (based in the comics). Still, It's entertaining, visually stunning and it's out of the MCU's pattern which is great. However, I'm not convinced of the Mandarin's motives. It kinda lacks evilness ( ""She"" is his weakness and that's why He's been easily manipulated by a beast and that kinda sucks). Everyone's scared of the Mandarin but in this movie they gave him too much of a heart. In spite of that, it is still a Great movie. I Enjoyed it Recommended to everyone."
"Watch it it's very good. It has the best fight scenes in any marvel movie ever with cgi on such a huge scale you would think it was an avengers movie. The music could be better as it lacks in that, but the action and the characters make up for it."
I could already guess the end watching only half of the film. It's like an 80's Chinese martial film.
"Destin Daniel Cretton, who mentored who mentored two academy award winners, Brie Larson and Rami Malek and another Academy Award nominee, Lakieth Stanfield has demonstrated he has no limitations. Two years in the making Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings delivers on every cylinder and it has at least 16.You will find yourself laughing out loud a lot! You will be dazzled by the remarkable beauty and you will be transfixed by the fight scenes. Especially the ones between Shang Chi's, (Simu Liu) mother, Jiang Li (Fala Chen) and his father, Wen Wu (Tony Leung) stunningly beautiful choreography, his sister,Xiangling (Meng'er Zhang) and finally, the one between his aunt. Jiang Nan (Michell Yeoh).The runaway bus is funny, brilliant, and exciting.The story is engaging, multi layered and satisfying in every way possible."
Loved it.Up there with the best Marvel films.Funny with great action scenes and 'Kate' is the best.
I was not expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did. I'm a sucker for a good martial arts movie and for traditional oriental music but we saw what happened the last time Marvel tried to do martial arts... (Iron Fist)This movie is without question in my top 5 Marvel movies! The action is incredibly choreographed and there is not an overabundance of it. The score is beautiful and I have found myself listening to it regularly since I saw this film. Character development is top notch. All of these things needed to make a great movie is wrapped into a nice package sprinkled with that Marvel charm we have come to love over the years. I can't stress how much you need to see this movie.
"I loved it, and so did the boys (my 25 and 31 year old boys)! It was funny, action-packed, and there was family drama on an epic scale. There was plenty of amazing martial arts action - my favorite was the first one on a runaway bus in San Francisco with 5 assassins and our reluctant hero. Also, there were magical creatures, a tragic love story, and a battle of good and evil. My older son is always the most critical of the three of us, and he loved it. His only criticism is that it wasn't much of a Marvel movie, but as an origin story, that did not bother me. There were 2 superhero cameos, and larger parts for Wong from Dr. Strange and Ben Kingsley reprising his role (as an actor hired to play a terrorist) from the Iron Man 3. In the end, the best thing that I can say is that when we walked out, we all said that we wanted to see it again!"
This movie had amazing choreography and a great story. It was a great mixture of comedy and seriousness and I can't wait to see what more they have of Shang Chi and the Ten rings.
"When you thought the MCU pulled everything out of the closet. This movie has everything. Amazing special effects, good editing, deserved character development and an intriguing plot. This movie is a solid blockbuster and very aesthetically pleasing.The only bad thing about it was that at some point in the movie, it's enough. The ending felt like it was being dragged out.This is the best MCU origin story by FAR."
"Great characters
strong plot
amazing visuals
pretty serious movie, none of the typical unnecessary marvel humour."
No one to really write reviews but after seeing this thought I would tell people how good this film is . I thought I would like it a mix of Martial arts and marvel but it far exceeded expectations . It's fun with a great story and fantastic action but the Comedy bits are hilarious a must see for any marvel fan üëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª
"Amazing CGI,story, beginning of a new character and absolutely amazing credit shot
In this movie every second your are going to open your mouth and surprised
Good luck for the fourth stage, This movie raised my expectations for other works, I pray they don't drop again."
"Movie was jam packed with great choreography , visual effects and story.Some parts pacing was too slow but in general a great movie!"
"Not sure how to review this movie, all I could think about was the other Chinese movie ""The Great Wall"". Effects were really good, but the movie was to slow for me."
What a movie.. Hands down brilliant.. Thank you Marvel for giving us such a new world.. Excellent from everyone.. Simu Liu is just a star and long way to go.. Best choice for the role.
"The 10 rings was the best weapon in marvel movies, the animation and action was beyond amazing..."
"First of all, I think People are overhyping this film a bit like they did Black Panther. Is this the Best MCU Origin Film Ever ?? Hell No !! There are atleast 3 better origin stories existing. But there's a lot of good things Shang-Chi does that differentiates this film from the normal MCU film. The Visuals are breathtakingly beautiful and unlike any MCU film I have seen. The tone of the film resembles Chinese Action Movies more rather than MCU which is so refreshing. The first few fight scenes are just incredible and got me super hyped but the quality falls in the later scenes when it becomes a CGI Monsterfest. The story is very predictable and full of narration and exposition. At its core its a very emotional family drama but the dialogues are not powerful enough to dig really deep and I craved for that in so many scenes. The performances are solid with Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley providing great Comedic Relief, but the standout is Tony Leung. He generates such level of empathy and emotional suffering with just his eyes, He is the Legend after all. Overall its a really fun watch, but not as great as people are shouting it is."
Awesome! I enjoyed it a lot. Visually entertaining. This is the best from Marvel since the End Game!Asians rule! I just wish they included more cast from North East and South East Asia! It would have been an even better representation!10/10! A great labor day weekend movie treat!
"Visually, one of the most beautiful movies in MCU. More than that, one of the best solo super hero movies in MCU, a grand feat for a debut, even more so without other superheroes like ""crutch"". The performances make justice for the script, showing us that End Game, contrary to what was believed, wasn't the end of Marvel Era. The phase 4 promises be even greater than others. This quality can be easily compared to Black Panter and Captain America and The Winter Soldier level.Engaging and with the right dose between comedy and battle, the film has impressive fight choreographies.The credit scenes make connection between the Shang-Chi story to the MCU in a curious way. Can't wait to see what Feige is planning for the future."
"The movie was funny, full of action and very wel made. Will definitely watch it in the cinema again."
Kudos Marvel for having the guts to make this film.
"What more do you want?I honestly didn't want to like this film. As you may have read in previous reviews of the Marvel films, they are all dumb. And this one ends as they all do, with just massive CGI chaos. But did I mention they were dragons fighting?Anyway, the film is fun. Fun and lively in the sense of watching a water painting come to life. The fight sequences are laborious...sometimes. Since being rocked with energy source that could topple buildings doesn't even crack a rib seems silly.But Shang-Chi makes it work. Here played by the moon-faced wide-eyed and fun loving Simu Liu. And he does a wonderful job NOT wanting to be anything but a typical slacker. While he carries the burden of a darker past..haunted, even...he does his best to make the best of his situation with his San Fran pal Katy. Now usually Awkwafina irritates me to no end. Here, she is much more subdued and is truly a ""bro"" any guy would want in a sisterly form/love interest. The balance of her hip banter to seriousness is flawless. And quite the joy when not on screen.Big kudos to Tony Leung. Who has spent generations emoting with the most efficient use of words. He doesn't require much and carries a lot. He plays a former evil doer whose only motivation is love.His fatherly love for his children is only surpassed by regaining a love he's lost. And truly embodies that person who cannot let it go. But that credit goes to Li, played by Fala Chen. A gentle soul in what can be described as Shangri-La. I could watch her do kata for hours. Her gracefulness would make any man want to open the gates of Hell for.Much praise goes to director Destin Cretton for balancing spirituality with family ties. This is a very difficult line to tow while trying not to be overbearing. He was smart enough to know that the family dynamics of an Asian household have small passive-aggressive moments that pick at the main characters. But doesn't ever go past the ""you must have honor"" trope that infects a movie like ""Mulan"""
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings tells the story of Shaun/Shang-Chi(Simu Liu). Shang-Chi is an expert of Kung Fu. He is forced to deal with his past, when he's pursued by the Ten Rings organization.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a mind-blowing film. The Marvel Cinematic Universe strikes gold yet again & can do no wrong! Director Destin Daniel Cretton has given us one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's best origin stories. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. It's awesome to finally see the Kung Fu fighting style, utilized in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The visual effects are awe-inspiring. Simu Liu is spectacular as Shaun/Shang-Chi. Liu easily balances the action, dramatic scenes & the Marvel Cinematic Universe's trademark humor. Can't wait to see more of him in the future. Awkwafina is hysterical as Katy. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is outstanding as Xu Wenwu. Meng'er Zhang is fantastic as Xialing. Fala Chen is brilliant as Li. Michelle Yeoh is excellent as Ying Nan. Florian Munteanu is superb as Razor Fist. The supporting cast is amazing. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a must watch for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans & superhero film buffs. Watch it on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX. Can't wait for Eternals(2021)!"
"""Simu Liu"" really brings everything to life and embodies Shang-Chi to complete perfection, almost as if he was born for this role, to a point where he will become marvel fans new favorite, and In my opinion, is on par with the casting likes of ""Roberts Downey Jr"" (bold statement I know), but along side ""Simu Liu"" actress ""Awkwafina"" will also steal the hearts of many fans, bringing many smiles and laughs to viewers faces and becoming something so much more then just a side character, fans will route to see her more and more in the future future.The actions scenes are nothing but bliss to see, perfectly choreographed fights that really capture the style and heart of martial arts. The special effects are beautiful to the eye and in the last two acts will simply blow you away and introduce you to a new world to see and new life to capture you and completely immerse you into the world of Shang-Chi.As for the story, Shang-Chi carries alot of weight and heart, that will provide many laughs with its humor but will also pluck the strings of every ones heart, with out saying to much, Shang-Chis story is something of a symphony with its story telling, what could of ended up being a basic story, end up being a deep, thrieving with life, story with plenty of meaning, with a broken family at its heart, each character has their story, taking their different paths back to be whole again. Some fans my leave with a tear or two.As a whole, Marvel manages to yet again, provide us an amazing cast to embody its iconoc comic characters and bring everything and every one to life on screen. Shang-chi, is a consistent adventure from start to finish and provides nothing but pure MCU entertainment at its finest, and will leave fans begging for more of Shang-Chi."
"After being disappointed by Black Widows' solo outing and not knowing anything about a minor comics character I feared for Shang-Chi. But I was not disappointed.Straight off and you get a cultured vibe honouring Asian film and tradition and you get superb action and charismatic characters all well delivered by a strong cast.Reminding me of Jackie Chan in his heyday, the martial arts is fast and creative. Shang-chi feels really grounded and fresh for the first half of the film and it's good to move away from too much wild. But then the second half blends Asian folklore and Marvel fantasy to truly deliver a spectacle. Without having to explain itself too deeply the consistent nods to Dr Strange remind you that other dimensions exist and people can bend powers in believable ways.Whilst it may not have needed to go so far onto fantasy, any true Marvel fan knows this is just another tuesday. The performances are strongly delivered and Shang-Chi is likely to become a new fan favourite."
Best movie marvel made imo.And probably my best theatre experience.
"I don't give 10/10 stars on most things but this was close. The thing that makes this different from a bunch of other superhero movies is that halfway through the movie I was already invested in the characters. Most origin movies focus on one or two characters to make you understand where they're coming from to prepare you for the sequel. But in this it was clear that the characters were all people with great depth. Comparing this to other marvel origin movies I would say that this one takes the cake, each and every one on one fight scene felt so tense and also like a dance. The cinematography was also brilliant, I could tell what characters were thinking and how they felt from angles and hue alone. I also really enjoyed how the movie wasn't all about Shang-Chi but it was also about all the other characters in his life and how they related to the situations they were in with him. With all this said I have to say that my favourite part was how invested I felt with several of the characters, I could understand the villains, Shang-Chi, and all the other main cast. They made it clear what they were thinking sometimes without any words, or saying something else.Shang-Chi: welcome to the MCU, I am so excited to see what comes next."
This film...is just brilliant without spoilers there's not much for me to say.Overall 9/10.
I saw all the trailers and all the press for the movie but wasn't that hyped for it if I'm being honest. Then I saw the movie and I must say...expectations were blown out of the water. The movie was great and something quite unique and refreshing for the mcu. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend.
I have witnessed something way beyond my expectations. This movie is fully action packed and well directed. Surely this is best part 1 movie of any franchise.
"As a Marvel hater I want to say this films is awesome, is not the terrible ""joke every 5 minutes"". I loved it, all the action and history is interesting."
"I was hesitant to watch this because i know how generic marvel movies are, but i was like why not? My mistake i guess, now i just feel like i wasted my money. It was so boring, might as well be streaming movie."
"So personally I'm not huge into the marvel scene so my score came as a surprise to me. The acting and character development was impressive in its own right, with a good scaling plot that never felt slow but built up like a good song.There were a few moments where the animation completely blew me away, I've seen every new film in the cinemas for the past while and plenty of animation in and out of cinema and some moments were truly incredible.Would recommend anyone to go and see this, easily my favourite action film and maybe my outright favourite film."
"The movie starts good...but...soon begins the flashbacks and the nosense humour and anti-climax scenes. And then the ""mandarin""....
Seriously, this shang chi movie is the worst marvel movie of all. Its sad because the pricipal actor does his job well, but all the other characters are bad to the bone."
"Bland pandering to the Chinese market with mystical martial arts and nothing explained. There's no tie in with main marvel universe that drives plot forward, just pointless cameos that amount to a shrug emoji from the other MCU heroes. Don't pay to see it if you can avoid it."
"The cinematography is good. The story is a bit slow, the fighting scenes are great but in the middle of some they just stop and stare at each other or just talk.Its' not the best mcu film and not close to the best ones.But it's a good movie to watch in the theaters."
"You could be mistaken for reading the title and thinking I was being sarcastic.Thankfully,I'm not. Just wow. I've been longing for that wow factor from the cinema since cinemas have reopened and this film gave me everything I wanted.Take away the fact that I am biased towards Marvel movies (guilty) this however is just a fanboy loving that Marvel have delivered once again, by that I mean top tier movies in the realms of Black Panther, Thor 3, GOTG, Infinity wars, Spider-Man just to name a few.From not having any major comic runs, to coming to our screens with this is jaw dropping movie, I can only show nothing but pure joy. From the culture, the mythical folklore, the mix of past/present and let's not forget the secret garden this film expands on the Marvel universe once again with an even deeper history.This film gave me real belly laughs, real emotional moment, a fantastic soundtrack to match this is a genuine winner for this year and Spider-Man may have his hands full beating what I can only describe as the best introduction to a unknown character since BP/GOTG. Shang-Chi needs to be a new staple in the Marvel franchise with new stories moving forward. Not to mention that fantastic performance from Simu Liu which has genuinely made me yearn for more of his portrayal!What an absolute treat and I've only watched it twice with a third viewing feeing more needed as the days go on.5 star all day, every day. Bravo!"
An iconic film with excellent combat.Perfect new start.
MCU new characters are always astonishing. Looking ahead for timely updates.
Superb superb superb very very good movie must watch in theatre....
A beautiful movie! It has really created a great start to the movies of phase 4 in marvel. Definitely see this! You will not regret it! This is the part that contains spoilers. It was such a twist when Trevor slattery came with his buddy Morris. If you have Disney plus rewatch iron man 3 before seeing it.
"The characters are a bit incoherent and straight up contradict their own characterizations at times, because the plot needs them to do it. There are a bunch of unneeded ""deux-ex machina"" or conveniences because the writers trapped themselves into corners for no reason (that's what happens when you get the 2021 ""Mortal Kombat"", ""WW84"" and ""The Expendables"" writers).Also, we have Awkwafina destroying every type of scene (dramatic; epic; and also the comedic ones) with one of the worst ""acting"" I've ever seen and a same type of joke (""awkward nonsense"") over and over, from start to finish, with a role ridiculously large for a dumb comic relief.But... Liu is actually pretty good as a lead (and his character is potentially great), and the ""Shang-Chi world"" is beautiful and it has everything to be super fun to watch in the future...without Awkwafine and better writers."
"The action is the movie's biggest selling point. The hand to hand combat is done exceptionally well and the use of the environment and camera movement added to the flow and intensity of each scene.Character development and interactions is also fine. The only criticism I have is how the final fight got a bit too CGI-heavy. It really didn't need the super fantastical elements and definitely took away the character development the story was building up to. It kind of just felt like the higher-ups said a Marvel movie needs something grandiose despite the rest of the film was kept grounded.Other than this, and the fact that a side character was able to pull a MVP hit out of thin air, the movie is very enjoyable. There is some truly breathtaking scenes and there's plenty of memorable martial arts scenes to go around. Growing up with these kung fu movies, I think you'll enjoy it as much as I did."
"A great introduction to a new Mcu hero, great marvel humor and can not wait to see more. They did the back story justice with this fresh take on the 10 rings."
"When watching Shang- Chi you will almost immediately see that it follows the same formula as every other marvel movie, but there is one thing that this movie excels at and that is the choreography. The choreography is some of the best seen in the the marvel universe and maybe even in cinema in general. The character of Shang- chi (played by Simu Liu) is a great addition to the MCU, but I can not say the same for some of the other characters in the movie especially the character Katy.(played by Awkwafina). The character is very flat and childish making her almost annoying though I believe that this is the fault of the writers and not Awkwafina. Another aspect of this movie that I like is the cameos, while I will not mention them to avoid spoilers, I will say that they are definitely one of my favorite parts of not only this movie but of the MCU in general. All in all I give Shang-chi a 9 out of 10. Great movie."
"For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff."
"My expectations for this movie was low, maybe it's due to the fact that there wasn't much hype around it but men it delivered awesomely."
"'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is absolutely on my list of favorite Marvel movies. 2021 has been full of hyped up films that have ultimately left me disappointed, but this one lives up to every bit of its hype.The action from beginning to end was some of the best I've seen in a Marvel movie or in general in a very long time. The choreography, especially when performed by Michelle Yeoh, Meng'er Zhang, and Fala Chen (and stunt doubles) felt like poetry in motion. Everything was done with so much grace and elegance that I did not want it to end. Simu Liu brought both charisma and charm as Shang-Chi while delivering some amazing action sequences too. He was nothing short of fitting for the role. And to my surprise ""Awkwafina"" was not as unbearable as I assumed she would be.The movie does lose some momentum in the 3rd act as it slows down a bit and takes a deeper dive into the story, but quickly picks back up as you head into the final battle. The set and CGI used creates some breathtaking shots that adds to the greatness of the film.Marvel fan or not this film is worth going to see."
"Shang-Chi has instantly entered my top 5 of Marvel movies. There is so much to adore about this movie. The visuals are beautiful, the villain is compelling, the last sequence isn't very predictable, as superhero movies can often be. The characters all have a level of depth that is often missing from the supporting characters in superhero movies, and I was pleased that they didn't marginalize Xialing as it would've been easy to do. I don't know much about the different disciplines of martial arts, but it seems very similar to Avatar: The Last Airbender in how they drew inspiration from different real world fighting styles for different fighters in the movie. If I compare the acting to the other movies I consider the best to produced by Marvel (Infinity War, Ragnarok, Winter Soldier, etc.), Shang-Chi is a notch below, but it blows every other Marvel movie out of the water when it comes to action and choreography. The bus scene in the first act has easily become my favorite sequence in any Marvel film. Origin films often fall into the same traps, but Shang-Chi doesn't, maybe because many didn't know much about the character. But even so, typical tropes like training sequences were done better in Shang-Chi, and the story didn't linger on his youth too much."
I loved the family narrative in this movie. Probably my favorite family in the mcu. The action scenes are very good and it was visually stunningThe thing that drags this movie down so much for me is that it introduces things and shows us things in a very messy way. I really want to love this movie but I can't. The soul suckers really messed up the story IMO. I feel like all the concepts introduced are very good but they aren't presented in the best way.
I've just got out the unlimited screening 10 out of 10 best marvel action origin film of MCU if u love action fantasy film this is Ur film.
This movie had everything from a great story to some of the best visuals I've ever seen.Shang-Chi has elevated the already high expectations from the MCU moving forward.
The movie had the most absolutely beautiful fight scenes. The hand to hand combat was amazing. Unfortunately the ending was a CGI boss fight scene. I wished it was more combat rather than a magic battle that marvel does.
"This movie was so well made. Of course it has your typical marvel magic, action, and comedy, but it's really fantastic. The build up, the dialogue, the action was all very moving. This is definitely worth seeing on the big screen."
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is very different from all previous Marvel movies, which is a good thing. I was a little worried at first that the film might not live up to the success Marvel pushed to give, but the film was actually spectacular and very entertaining. Good story, good acting, excellent character development, the action and choreography are outstanding, some funny moments, beautiful cinematography, and the VFX are a major step-up from previous Marvel films. This film was almost like the Aquaman of the MCU because it was a fun experience seeing it on the screen and presenting fans with something entirely new and unfamiliar. This movie is practically flawless. Can't wait to see Shang-Chi in future Marvel movies."
"Shang-Chi leaves San Francisco with his friend Katy in pursuit of old family secrets and discovers crime, danger, previously unknown family, quite a lot of wire-fu, ancient myths, and a couple of faces familiar to those who follow the MCU.This is the first MCU movie where I have been completely unfamiliar with the source material and, therefore not sure what to expect other than martial arts.well, I've seen a fair number of martial arts movies (without seeking them out), so the building blocks for Shang-Chi are not unfamiliar.But they are very engagingly assembled. The story is strong, with moral ambivalence playing a part. The action is extremely well choreographed and, at times - and in common with the settings and costumes - quite beautiful. This is a gorgeous film to watch. The effects are, as expected, first rate.The script is good, with much more laughter than I expected. It is helped here by Awkwafina - playing her typical raucous character she adds a welcome note of humorous disrespect, yet she also acts well and is sympathetically in tune with the plot and characters. Michelle Yeoh is stable and relatable. The leading character is, arguably, a little light on charisma, but this is not necessarily a bad thing given that one of the main plot threads is about Shang-Chi finding himself."
Outstanding marvel movie and waiting for the new version of avengers.
"Shang Chi movie review-
Some spoilers
Pros:
The story. I thought this movie would be boring just because it's a character that I am completely unfamiliar with but it actually was very interesting. Not just the plot but the origin and the backstory on peoples lives, I really loved the idea of it all. It incorporated a lot of cool Asian culture as well as some hip-hop American vibes and culture too. It was a very awesome combination.The characters you don't see in the trailer. One of the main characters is Shang-Chi's sister, the girl with the short hair and bangs (left in picture). She is by far the coolest character in this entire movie and I don't know WHY she is not on the front of more posters and more trailers! Katy played by Awkwafina isn't just the person in the movie that's the comedy, there are others too and although she is funny she actually has a lot more depth to her character and does have some serious moments, she's in the whole movie. I liked her more than I thought I would.The fight scenes and action. Shang Chi (Shaun) is extremely skilled in Kung Fu and actually has a fighting style similar to Batman. If he had a cape it would be awesome, but I know his character doesn't need it. There are very cool scenes that reminded me of scenes in Wakanda but in a mystical Asian land where there are dragons and other cool fictional creatures. The sets are beautiful!Some cameos and also the music. I won't spoil anything but there are some pretty cool cameos in this movie that definitely set up the world of the Marvel universe. Although the one cameo we'd all love to see we cannot. RIP Stan Lee. This film actually had some really cool music, the main character actually sings a song or two on the soundtrack as well as some really cool hip-hop music. I suggest to go check it out!Cons:Some plot holes. There were some moments were I got confused with some of the details of the plot. There were things that were not answered you have to figure out on your own. It's good to go to the movies with people so that you can talk about it afterwards and catch things. It is one of those movies where you may have to see it again to catch some things that you missed. I wish they made it a little bit more clear.The weird friendship between Katy and Shaun. In the movie you see that the two leads are BEST friends, they work together. But in the real world that is not very realistic. They kind of hint that there may be something that comes of it, some moments where I totally thought it was going to be romantic. I just wish they would either make it romantic or not, not somewhere in between. I'm sure there will be more movies where they may make them a couple eventually.The Mandarin. For those of you who don't know, that is the father of Shang Chi and Xialing (the real one not the drunk one on Iron Man 3). He is a very tough man, a villain. I don't like the aspect of making his father the villain even though that's the way I'm sure it is in the comic books. It just seems sad and not a good story that his dad sucks. I wish Marvel had some more Mufasas.All in all though it was great! Stay for all the credits there's two! It was better than I thought.8/10."
This movie was perfect. Allot of action plus allot of comedy. This is the funniest marvel movie ever. Also the storyline is pretty good. Considering that this movie used to be a comic and now it's a movie it's pretty good and they did a good job on it.
"It is.. impressive! Not because of the narrative which is pretty normal, nor the performance which is somewhat above average, it is impressive for the proper use of elements from Chinese myth.When the crew arrived the hidden Talo village, it is such wow! The mythical animals are exactly what I image them to be, the Long(dragon), Feng (fire bird), Kirin, Nine tail fox. It feels like they just came out of the Chinese mythical stories that passed down from generation to generation.And the Kong-fu too! The use of Tai-chi movement is smart, combining with the natural magic, the visual presentation is great! It is definitely a good movie for Kong-fu fans.The narrative is not bad, the legendary villain gave up everything for a beautiful girl, they lived happy life until his wife was killed during his enemy's vengeance. The miss of his wife led him to break the portal that blocks powerful alien monster. His son, inherited the power from both him and his wife, found his way to defeat the villain and the monster. The world turns to peace once again!Overall, 7 star for the narrative and performance, 1 additional star for the Kongfu and another for the mythical elements, absolutely love those animals!"
"This movie was phenomenal. We cant expect more from a solo superhero MCU film. Everything was perfect. All the scenes were great. The graphic works were so eye catching!! The dialogues specially the joke parts were great. In this movie they portrayed the family drama in a fantastic way. The action scenes are eye touching too. Also some parts were emotional when we almost cried....If any of you who have not still watched the movie and reading this comment,my first suggestion will be please don't miss the mid credit scene. Your mind will gonna blow up!!!"
"I really, really enjoyed the movie. The fight scenes in particular. As a fan of old school Kung Fu movies and the way they design the fighting scenes to look was just my cup of tea. That built up and exceled when the super hero fighting took place as well, it was just fighting perfection for me.The soundtrack of this movie was off the charts, starting from the opening scene, to the train fight scene and throughout.Now the visuals... they were... stunning.Humour was well placed and got a giggle or two out of the whole cinema, especially with Trevor, hahah.If it had just a biiiiiit of more depth in the story it would be a 10/10."
"There are no words to describe the look of this movie, it makes Spielberg's Avatar looks like indie project compared to the beautiful cinematography of this movie. The humor was on point. I haven't laughed at a marvel movie this much since Thor ragnarok."
"So good! I loved it. Exciting, funny, visually stunning, likeable characters, amazing action sequences, I recommend it!!"
"I like this movie very much, the action fighting is very good."
"Like many, I was concerned that this new Marvel Cinematic Universe saga would have trouble living up to previous standards but Shang-Chi has already left me hopeful for the series' future. I literally know nothing about this character but I found his film debut to be a solid superhero adventure; well acted, effectively character-driven, occasionally funny, rich with cultural representation and booming with swift and stylized martial arts action. It has what I hoped I was going to get from Black Panther: inclusivity AND an interesting world and narrative. I'm 100% all for representation but the story and characters must be pronounced, too and I just found this entry to be a lot more distinguished and captivating.Although Shang-Chi treads the familiar origin story formula, there's a few fresh twists and turns that uniquely sets this character's journey apart from the others. Though the first half is decently entertaining with some identifiable drama and fast-paced yet slightly derivative set-pieces in urban environments, the second half is where the film really turns on (at least for me). The Chinese philosophy kicks in, the mythology is abundant, there's tons of visually striking imagery, a fantastical setting, loads of insane action choreography. The Asian representation is just off the chain and I was so enraptured by it. It doesn't feel contrived, I sensed a great deal of respect for it and all the while an engaging story was unfolding. A nice balance. I was very satisfied with what I saw. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of Shang-Chi's world and how it'll tie in with other stories yet-to-come. Very cool movie. Soulful, cultural and action-packed."
"Very well done. Great writing, directing, and acting. Beautiful choreography and cinematography. Loved the costumes."
"Let me start off by saying that this film is a nice blend of spider-man, and ant-man, when you look at the personality and humor of the characters. But in a way, this is honestly every marvel movie in one. The visuals are reminiscent of dr strange, the humor is quite like ragnarok, and the characters and backstory is just fantastic. A great movie to watch with your family, but it's also great for marvel fans. Maybe one of the best marvel superhero origin stories. The pacing is decent, and the visuals are phenomenal. And you'll be happy with all the little easter eggs and extras. This is a very fun movie, it's not too dark, and i can recommend this for every marvel fan out there, it's definitely worth the watch. You will not be to disappointed."
"Loved The Way How the Story Revolves around Shang chi
It's like a Fantasy Journey to His World
And The Actions are Super satisfying .Can't wait to see them on next avenger Film."
"WOW! This movie wasn't bad at all...-the action fight scene was a mixture of classical chinese martial arts choreography as flying & floating around as some 1970s classic chinese kung fu movies like hidden dragon, crounching tiger & jet li's once upon a time in china with also realistic fighting style as well as jackie chan fighting style with a mixture of fantasy magic power of fighting style like ""dragon ball-Z"" lol.-the romance scene was soo beautiful with both shang-chi mother & father a better romance movie than other marvel superhero movie lol.-the landscapes & background graphics were so amazing well done! It is soo enjoying to see a beautiful landscapes of grass, trees, & with chinese mythology creatures.-the funny scene was really enjoyable to watch with mostly KATY !! Shang-chi close friend lol.-the storyline was 4 main character was SHANG-CHI, XIALING, WENWU, & JIANG LI. It was a very well done well written story line plot of these 4 main characters by showing flashbacks to the past of what had happened to these 4 characters.-the script was well done some had some serious scripts as WENWU,XIALING & SHANG-CHI but only 2 has the funny scripts as KATY & TREVOR SLATTERY! Lmao.-2 villains that work for WENWU was very well done made with their own job to do which was Razor-fist & Death dealer...-the most sad drama part was shang-chi father being stuck in the past with his wife that died long ago. Its was heart felt as heart broken... :-(the 2 BIG REASON why i gave this movie a (9 out of 10!) It is because 1! I wish the movie shows how shang-chi father WENWU! How he FOUND THE 10 RINGS of power as in the marvels comic book!!! In the comic book the story of shang-chi father FOUNDED THE 10 RINGS in a landing crashed ALIEN SPACE-SHIP across china thousands of years ago that crashed into a village mountain in china & 2! I wish marvel show the history of the 10 RINGS criminal organization as a flashback in iron man 1 to iron man 3...."
"Didn't have high hope before going in because neither Simu nor Awkwafina was a superhero movie casting material, and Mandarin is a very controversial villain of choice, but I was pleasantly surprised on how good Shang-Chi was.The chemistry between Simu and Awkwafina was exceptional, and Tony Leung's casting of Not-Mandarin aka Xu Wenwu was not just amazing, but one of the best villains Marvel has ever seen. It's a villain whose motivation is actually both believable and relatable. Oh, and the actual ""Mandarin"" was also a comical gold.Plus, fighting scenes were absolutely amazing. First half's martial art scenes were on par with some martial arts classics and later half of, well, typical Marvel CGI stuff were quite of eye candies.Sure, there were few less developed character arcs like Shang-Chi's sister but overall, this is an excellent movie that won't disappoint you."
"Easily landed in my Top 3 MCU Films Thus Far. All the epic action and gorgeous cinematography you'd expect from a wuxia movie with a Marvel budget, with great acting from Leung and Awkwafina and particular and rich references to Chinese myth."
"Story is balanced - contains multiple dark topics and dark events but it has strong comedy vibes too. And finally, a movie where trailer didn't betray all the story, it has even some magic in it. Recommended to all fans of kung fu and to all fans of Harry Potter."
"Marvel Studios has gained a glamorous reputation throughout the last decade, and this film was a huge milestone for superhero cinema, Asian representation, and the studio as a whole. Like Black Panther was to a lot of African-American audiences, Shang-Chi will ignite a spark in the hearts of Asians. This film opens the door to a relatable character and I love Simu-Liu's portrayal of Shang-Chi. I have watched Simu previously in the show Kim's Convenience as a comedic character and there couldn't have been better casting for Shang-Chi. Simu reflects the combination of an Asian-American character superbly and has an amazing screen presence. His character reminded me of Captain America because of his leadership role in the film, standing up against all odds, and overall amazing chemistry with the rest of the cast. Awkwafina's character, Katie, was an amazing character, filled with comedic relief that gave a lighter tone, to a film that was a little bit too dark for a Marvel film. Tony Leung's character, The Mandarin stole the show with a vengeance. Tony Leung is absolutely ground-breaking in every role he plays and The Mandarin was a unique role he took on. Leung had an amazing screen presence and was my character in the film. The visual effects in the film were unique and I could see that the animators had taken inspiration from traditional Chinese films regarding Martial Arts, also having similarities in design to Doctor Strange. The action in this film was mind-blowing like I was expecting, and I loved the fight on the bus. The soundtrack was average, with the usage of traditional Chinese instruments. The songs used in the film were composed by primarily Chinese Hip-Hop artists and I enjoyed them. The writing in this film was good, but not great. One of the criticisms I have about the film is that the plot did not feel original and could've been executed far better. There were a lot of parts in the middle of the film that stole away from the central plot of the film. This film had a more emphasis on magic and fantasy as suppose Kung Fu. Overall, this film is hands down one of the best gems Marvel has produced, and I cannot wait for Shang-Chi to integrate with the Marvel Cinematic Universe further."
"The first film in the MCU's next phase was BLACK WIDOW, but that film, which featured Scarlet Johannson's swan song as the title character, felt very much like it was grounded in what had come before, but SHANG-CHI: THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS very much breaks new ground, and takes us into a heretofore only hinted at corner of the Marvel Universe. It's the origin story of the title character, a martial arts superhero, but he is not nearly as well known as Spider-Man or Captain America, so we are not treated to yet another iteration of Uncle Ben's demise. Instead we are given a fleshed out story of a tragic family, one without easily defined villains. Shang-Chi joined the Marvel Comic scene in 1973 in an attempt to create a character that could cash in on the Kung Fu craze at the height of Bruce Lee's popularity. He had his own book for many years, interacting with other Marvel heroes, and if he has not been a Marvel regular in recent decades, Shang-Chi has never gone away, and retained the loyalty of many hardcore fans.Like all origin movies, SHANG-CHI begins with some exposition and back story, specifically concerning his father, Wenwu, played by Tone Leung, a power hungry thousand year old immortal, who wields the Ten Rings of the title, a fearsome mystical weapon of an unknown source. Only when he meets Li, played by Fala Chen, a fighter from the hidden realm of Ta-Lo, does he find someone who is his equal in combat. Falling in love, Wenwu forsakes his violent ways, and starts a family with Li. But in every hero's origin story there must be a tragedy, and when Li is murdered by Wenwu's rivals, he seeks vengeance, becoming the villain he once was, and teaching his son and daughter how to become deadly assassins. When we meet Shang-Chi, well played by Simu Liu, he is a twenty something Chinese immigrant living in San Francisco making a living as a parking valet with his best friend/girlfriend, Katy, played by Awkwafina, having broken from his father's world. But as with most stories centering on estranged families, the plot turns on them being drawn back together, and Wenwu needs a pair of pendants belonging to Shang-Chi and his sister that were gifts from their mother because they are essential, he believes, if he is to free his deceased spouse from the Dark Realm, whose entrance lies inside Ta-Lo. And if Shang-Chi doesn't want to go along with Dad's plan, too bad. It all comes to a head in an epic battle in Ta-Lo in a CGI heavy third act - pretty much a staple for the MCU.I liked this movie because it has plenty of energy, with great well done action scenes, along with some spectacularly staged martial arts battles. It also has a lot of heart, with characters who are easy to become invested in. And this lighter touch is welcome after the dark turns of AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR. In Tony Leung, it has a great villain with an understandable motive, something essential with any good super hero film. Simu Liu is an appealing lead, and he's matched all the way by Awkwafina's Katy, an underachiever who discovers special skills. I am not always impressed with CGI laden film making, but I don't mind it here because I actually care about the all too human characters involved in the action. The finale in Ta-Lo is supposed to be the high point of the movie, but for me, nothing beats the battle on the careening city bus on the streets of San Francisco early in the film, where Shang-Chi first shows his true martial arts prowess against his father's minions, led by the fearsome Razor Fist, played by the physically impressive Florian Monteneau. Michelle Yeoh has a part as a village elder, and out of nowhere, Ben Kingsley returns as actor Trevor Slattery, thus redeeming what for many of us fans what was one of the more disappointing villain tweaks from IRON MAN 3.An early scene at a Hong Kong fight club firmly establishes that all this is happening in the MCU with appearances by Benedict Wong's character from DOCTOR STRANGE, and the Abomination from THE HULK. Wong returns in a post credits scene that clearly sets up Shang-Chi and Katy for the big leagues in the next phase of the MCU. Will they learn where the Ten Rings came from, and maybe does THE ETERNALS have anything to do with it? And there is the dangling plot thread of what exactly happened when Shang-Chi was sent to kill the man responsible for his mother's death when he was 14; it was the event that estranged him from his father. Something tells me we will find out in some future installment. I can hardly wait."
Felt like an early Marvel movie. The movie focuses on one quality story without the need for crossovers to make people see it.
"I went to the cinema to watch this movie in IMAX 3D and the money was definitely worth it. Honestly this is my favourite stand alone film in the MCU. The visual effects are outstanding, as well as the fight scenes and some good comedy though :)). I recommend everyone (not just Marvel fans) to watch this movie."
"I absolutely loved this movie, the cinematography, the flight choreography, storyline, etc was beautifully done. I also loved that this was a proper origin story that yes referenced the MCU to tie it in for future projects but was seperate enough for Shang-Chi to take the limelight as he should. Also loved the surprise characters that turned up, Trevor was absolutely hilarious in this movie with his partner is crime Morris."
"Although I found some of the backstory to be unnecessary, Shang Chi is a fun, action packed adventure, and a welcome Marvel newcomer. Simu Liu and Awkwafina make a great team and I look forward to seeing future adventures."
"It's great...! Really...
this review is too short."
"I found the movie enjoyable in parts but there were some boring parts too. It's definitely not a 10/10 movie, in fact nowhere near. It's a decent film that doesn't take itself to seriously but like all of these type of films it's predictable."
"This movie blew me away with the effects and how beautiful it is , the fight scenes were so greatly choreographed and the tracking cinematography was just perfect and made the scenes flow so well , the backgrounds were just perfect and very aesthetic . The chemistry between the characters was just perfect and the jokes were funny, its so good to see a platonic relationship between a man and a woman . It is definitely worth a watch at the cinema."
"I really wasn't expecting this to be so good but it was, and more so. Just when you thought that End Game had wrapped everything up you can see yourself getting sucked in all over again."
Martial-arts master Shang-Chi confronts the past he thought he left behind when he's drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization.
"""I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you? You walked in my shadow.""Marvel Studios' Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings follows Shang-Chi, a seemingly ordinary young man from San Francisco who parks cars for a living alongside his friend, as must confront the past he thought he left behind when he is drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization. Marvel took a big chance on this project. Of course we've had lesser known heroes end up getting their own movie franchise within the MCU, but Shang-Chi is not one many know about. Little was known going in other than we'd get some action scenes and explore new territory within the MCU. What they managed to do with Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is unlike any Marvel movie yet. Destin Daniel Cretton takes a new approach that works wonders. His previous works of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy are heartfelt dramas so something big like this is new territory, but he incorporates the same style and messages into this. The dysfunctional family dynamic serving as the character arc and forming the conflict is so much deeper than some random business guy who wants to rule the world. With this story, it's easy to connect with it and understand character motives. I will say there's a lot to pack in here and the story can get muddy at points, but it pulls itself together that we retain most of everything.Simu Liu is fantastic in the title role. Previous to watching, I hadn't seen him in anything. But he has all the skills as an emerging actor to be a household name. Shang-Chi is an interesting character to follow. As he discovers and recalls moments from his upbringing, we can slowly piece him together. There's much more to be made from him, but with future installments we'll be able to get much more. And Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is perfectly cast as Xu Wenwu. He's a villain I can understand, like, and dislike all at the same time. He's flawed, but there's depth to him. And he almost steals the show by the end with another showcase of mad acting skills. But the character I've been thinking of a lot, and mainly because she was so hilarious, is Awkwafina as Katy. Awkwafina is one of my favorite actresses working right now, especially after her role in The Farewell, and she smashes this. Katy is the typical comedic sidekick but so much fun. One of the funniest jokes comes from her and I was laughing hysterically. Maybe more character will come from her later, but what we got was enough for me. I can't wait to see her again! I should also mention Meng'er Zhang as Xialing. This is her first role and she's also great. What they'll do with her next should be interesting.From a technical standpoint, this is impressive for a Marvel movie. There are some stunning visuals. The cinematography isn't that gray color scheme used in most, though it does fall into that later on, and bursting with color. And as you probably know, the visual effects are as good as they come. It's not muddled with CGI and a scene that was completely green screen, which is nice to see. Also, Marvel has been doing great with the themes and score lately because this is another great one, along with the soundtrack. Paired with this are the best fight scenes out of the whole MCU. The stunt choreography is top notch and is beautiful and intense to look at. The bus scene early on is the best yet and will be hard to top! Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings just really did it for me and most everybody can agree. It's refreshing and captivating in every way. Marvel has been taking some big leaps with this new phase and it gets me more and more excited for each new installment!"
I mean this move was just a fun ride from start to finish with secrets and just really good nods to Asian mythology.
"Shang Chi has a hallmark of being a big budget film, but it missed the mark in its attempt to be simultaneously an Asian martial arts film and a marvel film.On the positive side, the animations and the choreography are really well-done, and they demonstrate significant amount of planning and thought. However, the film lacks coherence as it intertwines sharply opposing scenes from a fight club in Macau to a peaceful fantasy Chinese village to downtown San Francisco. Comedy is used to punctuate the film, but they feel very out of place in a movie about a Chinese American aiming to kill his father, an idea that is so opposed to the ordinary Chinese-American worldview that the film should deserve more gravity. The costumes evoke a feeling of the characteristically ineffective attempt by Hollywood to mix Eastern and Western styles. In the village scene, bright artificially-coloured clothes contrast with the natural objects surrounding them (wood statues, old temples, trees, and magical creatures).Additionally, the movie is somewhat clich√©, unrealistic, and illogical. The back story is one involving a long-vanquished evil threatening to come back, and the true vanquisher of such evil already lays under a a lake and (presumably) would have prevented the evil from coming back even without the protagonist's help. The side character predictably must be the one who saves the village at the critical moment despite having no prior training in archery whatsoever. Have I become too grown up to appreciate such a storyline? Marvel cannot simply hide its shoddy plot work by pre-empting the critics in the bar scene. Every major scene in the movie have significant similarity with some previous movies. The fight ring was in spiderman; the village was in Kungfu Panda; Fights in buses and scaffoldings have been done countless of times before.So what's new? What makes this movie special? On a martial arts standpoint, it pales in comparison to Tony Leung's previous films. On an ""Asian empowerment"" standpoint, it lacks authenticity and its fantastical nature prevents any serious message from being conveyed. Indeed, the viewers are left wondering whether this movie champions the family or the freedom from it.The characters development is also lackluster. They were the ones who scorn social expectations and the ones who wish to have fun. How did they transition to people who will risk their lives to protect a village?Overall, Shang-Chi seems to disappoint.5/10."
Typical Marvel Movie- Lots of Action & Laughs. I saw this in IMAX and loved it! If you are a Marvel fan you will enjoy this movie. 2 extra credits so stay until the end.
"The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres. It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.Awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits.Without stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong's superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers.Regarded as one of the finest actor's Chinese cinema has every produced, Tony Leung stamps his class all over the film, giving an engrossing, captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the Ten Rings.His inner moral dilemmas and love/hate relationship with his children are portrayed brilliantly by the man nicknamed 'Small Tiger' among the Five Tiger Generals of Hong Kong CinemaThe flashback sequences help to build up Shang Chi as a character and intricately captures his upbringing as the heir-apparent to a genocidal megalomaniac, and how despite wanting nothing to do with his father's murderous tendencies, as his son, he is inadvertently drawn to the Mandarin's world of violence and carnage.The films delves into mystical elements towards the climax and with two surprise-laden post-credit sequences tie into both Doctor Strange's world of Mystic Arts as well as a possible connection that the Ten Rings has to alien technology.As always, the way weaves in each individual fim character to the wonderful tapestry that makes up each of its Phases is a joy in itself.It is due to the well-written characters and the nuanced acting of its performers that Shang Chi stands out while the eye-catching CGI and elaborately chorographer action sequences add more gloss to the end product.Another wonderful new addition to the MCU world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on.Highly recommended. A must watch. Marvel's Phase 4 continues to raise the bar!"
Still can't get over the movie even after watching it for two times in two days.Didn't want to miss this in theatres as this is releasing after two years. One of the best Marvel movie out there.
"I have seen it at the premier. 3D is recommended. It seems Marvel is siding toward mystic and magic instead of science. As I am a hardcore marvel fan since my childhood, I liked it. Specially the Bus fight scene. Don't know about casual watchers."
"I heard that this film was going to be good, and it was better than I had imagined!! The storyline was really new and exciting for the mcu, the fight scenes were fantastic I couldn't keep my eyes of the screen. It also had its funny parts just like marvel always has! I can't express enough how much I enjoyed this film."
This is not even close to what the Shang-Chi Comic story line was.Where is the Marvel comic Shang-Chi Character and at least some parts of that story line?This is one of the greatest Epic fails ever made by the MCU so far.
"Everybody was kung fu fighting for 2 straight hours and it¬¥s just bad.It starts okay, then it just gets worse by the minute.If this is the new direction Marvel is headed, then it¬¥s just sad.Really a bad movie and the story is rubbish, acting is bad and the best thing is that I saw it for free."
"The Action in this film is top top notch , something we missed in marvel movies and shows, something very similar to what we saw in daredevil and iron fist.I loved how this movie is tied to past and future marvel projects , making it an exciting and welcomed addition.Actors did 10/10 in everything , and the story was well developed.Don't forget : 2 post credit scenes."
"From the never ending awesome action sequences to the beautiful music that enhances the experience tenfold, this movie is a masterpiece."
"This was my initial first thoughts before entering the cinemas, ""am I going to enjoy it? Will it be filled with cgi crap?"" Well yes, but no. It was so beautifully done, that it made me saw wow at the end. This is something that you would wanna see in the theaters, it was so beautiful I even got posters for free of the movie to remind me of it. It's a movie you don't want to miss, seriously!"
"What a fun ride with some emotionally touching scenes. Tony Leung Chiu-wai worked hard at making his character a different kind of villain who is not stereotypical and the way he loses connection and wallows in grief is deep. You can see what is causing him to act as he does.Simu Liu carries this movie alongside Tony Leung and it's got a lot of father/son conflict which is touching to see on screen.The fight scenes are really good, the action is top notch and I liked the friendship running along in the story. Stay for the two end scenes which tease so much!"
"I had read the advance reviews and was excited about the positivity and glowing feedback I'd seen. It means a lot to Asian-Americans to finally be put in the spotlight, and by a juggernaut like the Marvel machine no less.Went to see a late night showing on Thursday, Sept 2nd, technically a day in advance of the official release date. Happy to say the movie did not disappoint. I've watched so many Hong Kong style movies over the years and the Shang-Chi film-making team did a spectacular job of importing that authentic, Asian-flavor of film-making. They did the kind of research I've come to expect from Marvel's creative team, and let this team leave their own distinct Chinese style from using Mandarin-speaking dialogue in strategic moments, to the very distinct style of Chinese-influenced music (totally awesome!), and the kung-fu sequences on the scaffolding, which is something you see in many of the old school Kung Fu movies. Michelle Yeoh, in particular, acted in many a movie in this vein back many years ago.The filmmakers did a great job of melding old-style, Authentic Chinese Kung Fu cinema and themes (father-son tension, motherly devotion, male prioritized over female, etc .) with current Asian-American themes (underachieving children and over-expecting parents, general confusion in American society) and combining everything in the context of a fantasy-action movie with trademark Marvel humor to lighten things up.I was a fan of the special effects throughout the movie, and thoroughly enjoyed the ending sequence as well. Like other reviewers, I loved the opening fight sequence between Tony Leung and Fala Chen. It's wonderful to see that Tai Chi - style of fighting introduced in a Western, blockbuster movie.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a great movie but with Shang-Chi, I think Marvel achieved something more in melding disparate parts and taking on much more in bringing together cultures, generations and viewpoints in the context of a MCU superhero action movie. The next time we see Shang-Chi, there's no doubt most of us - moviegoers of all colors and cultures - we will be happy to see him again."
"These positive reviews mean nothing, everyone already knows it's bad movie. Most people who leave positive reviews haven't even seen it yet. I actually went and watched it. It's so generic."
"I'm not gonna to lie, I wasn't excited for this movie. The first teaser was underwhelming and the official trailer didn't get me hooked either. Either way I'm a huge MCU and Marvel fan so I decided to go watch it either way. IT WAS AMAZING. The film was only 2+ hours but it contained soo much, the setting changed so much. The actors did a great job, the cinematography was great and CGI was spot on. The only complaint is that the movie felt very cringe ish at some times, especially during the first 10 minutes. But the movie gradually got better, still having some cringey scenes during the run. I know some people have their complaints on Awkwafina but she really did a great job. Simu Liu's character was lacking at times though but I'd definitely say he has one of the best debut characters in terms of personality.*And why people are reviewing this now is because it was released on September 1th in a few countries.Also spoiler, Abomination's character only did a very brief appearance, it was so brief so that I was unable to even film him.Also, we have another bad guy who will show up later in the MCU ;)"
"The action in this film is on another level,
The cinematography is new propaply the best among all marvel films.The last battle didn't really satisfy me but I enjoyed this film unlike many others,
I hope that marvel keeps it up."
"The movie's CGI and action sequences were top tier, but the story and writing, the most important parts of a film, were predictable and simplistic.Character motives were shallow and stereotypical and I was not emotionally invested in the family or any individual character. Once you understand that the movie is about family, which you can pick up right away, the plot, conflicts, and resolution are entirely predictable.The movie had its classic Marvel funny moments (diffusing tense moments with surprising humor), but I cringed in plenty of scenes too. This movie had a poor ending with little emotional catharsis. The ultimate conflict was resolved with CGI, magic, and deus ex machinas, like the average action blockbuster, which might have been acceptable if it had emotional depth or moral complexity, but it didn't.Overall, the movie was a typical superhero film about family bonds with Kung Fu and dragons. As much as I love the Chinese representation, as I am Chinese, the movie itself was disappointing."
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)Well what a pleasant surprise, very much in the style of Black Panther, this origin story was really great from start to finish.I saw this at the 3D 4DX at the O2 and we were thrown about, blown on, rained on and every other sensation at every turn it was fab-u-lus!We had some great acting some great humour and plenty of ""magic"", for Marvel fans after the lacklustre Black Widow, the disaster of the Winter Soldier. Two goodens in a row what with Snake Eyes!The fight scenes we well worked through and the opening bus sequence was very memorable. I don't thing there was anything I didn't like about this movie so I'm giving 10 outta 10."
"I was so excited for this movie and I was not disappointed. It had cgi, an amazing cast, a great soundtrack, setting etc. I have nothing bad to say about this movie. Other than that I dislike some of the bad guys, but that's what makes them bad guys so...
I was so shocked when I saw the end credit scene with Hulk and Captain Marvel and Wong. I love Shang-Chi and Katy's friendship and I just think that this movie is awesome. Also the martial arts and the stunts were awesome, especially the train scene and the fight in the Macao. So I'm just ending this to say that I love this movie and it's my new favourite marvel movie!!"
"Sorry. Kung Fu not my thing. Action sequences too fast to keep up with, end battle too busy and fast to keep track of who where doing what?If you didn't have an idea of the connections with the rings, then would be lost as to how this fits with Marvel at all....except for mid credits trailer.For me, below par, too busy and mediocre at best."
This is hands-down movie of the year. Do yourself a favor and go see this on the big screen! This is one of those movies there in 20 years you'll say I seen that on the big screen!
After two and half years gap all the audience came back together to watch a Marvel movie shang-chi and the legend of the ten Rings is one of the most action packed and entertaining movie it does it keeps you engaged till the end of the movie The action sequences and the visual effects are top-notch the costume designing and the actors you simu like awkwafina the theatres were Housefull in India. This movie has a craze in India one of the best moral movies after 2 years at soft tomorrow will must watch movie only in theatres not in home.
"I watched the movie in real 3D, the 3D part was wonderful, but that's where the Wonder ends. The storyline was, well there was no storyline. There was no depth to the characters, 2 hours into the movie I was hoping that it would just be over already. Very disappointing movie."
"So you want your son to come see you and your plan is to send a team of assassins to kill/collect him? You might lose your son, lose some henchman, and reveal your organization on the internet. This is the first action sequence and one of the first overall scenes of the movie; the poor writing sets a bad tone for the rest of the movie. Your defense is you don't think your assassins could kill him; but your goons had the element of surprise and you haven't seen your son in 10 years so how could you know if he's gone soft or not. Main actor performance: C; best friend performance: D; sister performance: C; dad: C. The aunt's performance was an A; but maybe I'm biased because I loved her in Crouching Tiger."
"Before anyone thinks I am a straight white male who is not allowed to have opinions- let me tell you I am asian myself. Now the movie is truly overrated. Action is good, Virtue signaling was limited but not absent. Cliche MCU formula really is off putting. The only novelty was the looks of the actors. I did not get overly bored but I would not have missed much if I did not watch it."
This was by far the most boring MCU title I've seen to date. It was basically two hours of the same fight scene done over and over. I really hope this isn't indicative of the direction the MCU is headed post-Endgame.
"How has this movie 8.1 rating makes no sense. This movie was super generic. I was expecting something great, but it was worse than Black Widow and that's not easy thing to do."
"I was really looking forward to this movie. Initially, I was a bit upset that I wasn't going to be able to watch it on Disney+. However, after experiencing it on the big screen, I was so thankful I HAD to go to my local theatre to watch it. As a Chinese Australian, you rarely get to see characters that are similar to you. It was so nice to see asian experiences displayed unapologetically on the screen. The reviews that discuss how next level the martial arts are, really were telling the truth. I have seen plenty of Chinese dramas where martial arts is displayed full on & I always found myself thinking the filming direction was a bit off. This movie combined martial arts from the Chinese dramas & it was so natural and perfectly impactful. It is definitely not like the action shown in 2020's Mulan. The SFX was STUNNING, it's better than what the other Marvel movies have shown & we were just amazed at the effort and details that were placed.I'm no acting major so I don't know my stuff but I did find some of Simu Liu's facials to be a tad awkward or a little too exaggerated however, he was still, nonetheless, wonderful in this role. Tony Leung, my god, he was the moment. He really shone in this movie for me. His natural swag & cool demeanour was so attractive and I really could not hate his character. I enjoyed Awkwafina's acting in this movie, she really knows how to deliver humorous lines & I'm glad she had an impactful part in the movie & wasn't just the comedy relief.It did hurt to see that my cinema wasn't packed especially since my area is full of Asians. They may have not known about the movie since Marvel barely did any advertisement for it. I definitely hope in the future I get to see more support for Shang-Chi & the other members.Regarding the credit scenes: the mid credits scene was definitely a ""huh, that's interesting"" moment but probably not something to cause any uproar over. I'm interested to see where it goes.Overall, I REALLY enjoyed this movie. There was so much Mandarin incorporated in the movie that I am able to take my parents to watch it too!"
"5 out of 5 stars.Shang-Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture. I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.Great epic plot. Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) enter a hidden world Ta Lao where there is magical mythical creatures. Is like a wow stunning moment when you first see Wakanda in Black Panther. The film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable.The cast ensemble is great. Simu Liu did great with the character along with Awkwafina as his friend. Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Florian Munteanu, and Tong Leung all did great.The set designs and visual effects are stunning and great. Can be colorful at moments. The music score was good as well. The action sequences are great and exciting. Every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography. Director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences. Even with the epic climax of the dragon battle.There are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu.I will say Shang Chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving. Action packed. And a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven."
An absolutely amazing movie! Some of the best special effects and fight sequences you'll ever see! Definitely a must-see!
"Just saw the movie in the theater and I haven¬¥t spoken a word since. The movie truly takes you on a journey you don¬¥t expect. The characters are the most immersively written ones yet, you can truly relate to (most) all of the main ones. Tied in beautifully with modern culture, I love the platonic friendship between Katy and Shang it feels real. The movie has it's moments of just sheer beauty. And I liked the humor. Does it have some points of improvement? Sure. The immersion was broken a handful of times for me, however all together I loved the journey I was taken on. For anyone who hasn't seen it yet. 10/10 Fantastic journey, enjoy the experience!(p.s. The music was sick, I loved it!)"
"Amazing film, setting up Phase 4 Marvel beautifully! Can't wait to see what happens next."
"The action in this film was in fact a character. Simi Liu, Awkwafina, and of course Michelle Yeah deliver beautiful performances! Shang Chi is this generation's Iron Man. The MCU is in perfect hands."
"The freshest new intro superhero film since Black Panther. Brilliant Asian casting elevates this latest Marvel addition which is crowd pleasing, emotional and visually strong. Some cute extra scenes in the credits so stick around."
"Rotten Tomatoes makes it seem like it's on same level with Spider-Man 2 or The Dark Knight, but it's not even close to same level. It's most basic mcu origin story possible. What's the point of these scores when one movie is masterpiece (Spider-Man 2) and another is super mediocre (Shang-Schi), but both have same rotten tomatoes score. It makes no sense."
"It's simply too generic and jokes don't land at all. Not recommending, maybe wait for streaming."
"Overall very disappointing (as expected) another generic marvel flop. It will obviously make no money, because nobody has never heard of this ""superhero""."
"Incredibly boring and indifferent film, with stereotypical characters and a predictable story, following the superheroes formula. I watched the 3-D version, which looked like bad animation and completely distanced me from the film. The only redeeming qualities were a few inspired shots and the inclusion of some decent actors -- especially the wonderful Michelle Yeoh."
"I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.Don't get me wrong.. it IS a spectacle! The action is great. The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.The next issue is the humor, which didn't land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn't her normal ""loud"" self that's supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn't ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.Finally, the third act is weak. There's a balancing problem with stakes. You can't feel tension or weight to any action. And there's a lot of superficial ""I can't do it"" until they can.In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn't feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn't feel like a comic book. It's more generic than that."
"When I saw the trailer a while back I wasn't expecting much, especially after Black Widow which was imo the worst MCU movie. However, the movie surprised me. The theme of a different culture reminded me of Black Panther but I enjoyed Shang Chi a lot more. I found it refreshing, the visuals were amazing, I enjoyed the action scenes very much. The plot wasn't the worst, but I felt like it was dragging out at times.Overall a very fun and enjoyable movie."
"I just simply love how beautiful this movie is! The actions, the visual, everything!"
"Just came back from the theater. Definitely great movie. Another blockbuster and big win for marvel. Hugely entertaining . It's as good as black panther.Shangchi original story-line is about revenge and blood for blood. Much more serious than other marvel themes. However, the emotions are diluted to the minimum because of his girlfriend Kathy aka awkwafina. I guess that's on purpose. Also Mandarin aka wenwu his father is much less evil than the original. Basically just a powerful guy losing mind for his beautiful wife. Shangchi himself has a funny character as well. So it's become a popcorn movie but still deep with emotions. Best marvel movie since the winter soliderThe only little regret for me is simu Liu's outlook. Man the face only deserves parking cars. I know Jackie Chan is also not good looking but shangchi to me is very handsome guy whose face is at least at the level of Donnie yen. Come on, he's a comic book super hero.It's already making history by breaking record of Labor Day sales of ANY movie, and it's three times more. Actually this movie is very hard to fail. You got Michelle yeoh the female Jackie Chan, tony Leung best actor in HK even China, awkwafina the best Chinese/ Asian American actress, fala Chan very good actress in HK, etc. This is a dream cast like the new Lakers."
"---Fast review: Good effect, exciting figth scenes, satisfying story---> I normally don't like most marvel movies because bla bla..
> However, as a martial arts fan, performer and chinese culture and mythology fan, i decided to watch it (because there is use of martial arts) and unexpectedly satisfied.> There is a good base, universe of chinese mythology. They may waste it but they definetly use it very well. Effects are realy good, i especially like effects of portals and water tornado of dragon.> Fight scenes (which is the most interested part for me of course) are really good, some parts are so fast to detect movements.> Visual effects of kung fu (not style of main character but his mother and her people) describe the philosophy under the style very well. Their kung fu is so smooth, basic and easily recognisable because most is traditional style.>I was very happy when i saw some movements that i use."
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an incredible MCU origin story that's epic, emotional and extremely thrilling whilst also connecting to the greater universe in fun and satisfying ways. It's definitely the best thing in phase 4 so far even if it's third act has some of the usual MCU problems.Simu Liu gives an incredible and extremely charismatic lead performance whilst also having superb chemistry with Awkwafina, who is also incredible. Michelle Yeoh and Meng'er Zhang are both great and Tony Leung is amazing as one of the better villains in the MCU with plenty of backstory and depth.Destin Daniel Cretton's direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and stylish with some of the best action sequences in the franchise. The fight choreography is extremely impressive and the CG is mostly strong. It's well paced and both the soundtrack and the music by Joel P. West are both fantastic."
"Charming and incredibly fun- Shang-Chi may not be the best Marvel has had to offer- but it is one of their better films in some time. My main problems with the film lie in the films storyline, which to be honest, is really good, but incredibly all over the place editing wise and there is just so much of it that it feels like two movies could have been made out of it. I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart. That being said, the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout. The action scenes are absolutely incredible, the look of the film incredibly well developed- something very fresh and original for Marvel studios- and the cast are all a joy to watch- especially Simu Liu and Aquafina in the lead and supporting roles. I was skeptical of Aquafina being in a Marvel movie for sure, but she really helped the film as a whole, and honestly I would love to see more of her character in future Marvel projects. The film is entertaining, despite the pacing of the film being a bit all over the place at times. It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile. In the end, Shang-Chi was a fun time for a Marvel movie- something most comic-book flicks have forgotten about recently- and i'm excited what this character has to offer in future films.My Rating: 8.6/10."
Honestly I start doubting that I saw another movie ! I don't know what all the hype about !! Another Marvel movie packed with a lot of action scenes and visual effects but weak and predictable story !
Clever story with amazing martial arts and interesting backdrops. I enjoyed and appreciated the English Subtitles that were clear to read and on onscreen longer the most movie subtitles. The martial arts was exhilarating! Loved it! The CGI was colorful and creative. This film should win multiple Oscar Awards!!This movie was so entertaining I must see it again!!
"Marvel had a huge opportunity to make this so much bigger and better than just a premise movie.Beautiful cinematography and the choreography was more than just stunt work. Acting a little rough here and there, the protagonist actor did a pretty good job though. That dry MCU humor we've grown to see didn't quite hit. I know a lot of people wished they would have done much more with Mandarin as he is a pretty big bad in the comics and they hyped him up a lot. But I think this movie just makes people excited for THE NEXT marvel movie rather than truly giving this MCU story life. And with the movie being 2 hours long, it felt so rushed and at the same time most viewers were waiting for it to just end.And I'll say it, she could be a nice gal but Awkwafina.... I just know I'm not the only one who finds her out of place on screen sometimes. And that's all I will say about that respectfully lol."
"This movie is both fine, yet very flawed. The first issue is pacing. It's quite exhausting. Action-break-flashback-action-flashback-action-break-break-break-flashback-action. It's as if you tried to first sprint, then suddenly halt and tip-toe-walk and then run a marathon only to sprint again.Second issue are flashbacks. This movie is riddled with them. And I don't mind them.. Unless they keep on returning to exactly the same scene over and over and over again with that difference that you get to listen to new part of the talk. I don't remember any other movie that was so riddled with flashbacks.Third issue are fights. Now this has to be broken in 2 groups; ""magical fights"" and ""down to earth fights"". The first was done terribly. Camera shake, way too close, badly lighted and confusing as heck. There was some vision, some idea, yes, but it turned into ""cgi slosh"". This could have been done oh-so-much better.. But we got pointless confusing close-ups then camera shaky-shaky moments instead. The second group reminds me of jackie chan movies, you know.. kung-fu stuff, which was great... To some extend.Fourth issue is main character. He's the extend from point earlier. He's like blank-slate punching bag in this show. He has no real emotions and just goes with the flow. He >never< speaks his mind and rather just silently mumbles his agreement for whatever plan others come up with. It was annoying. Really grating. Ok, I don't mind if MC is not an iron man of a character. But I had seen corpses put more action while being decomposing than Shang chi. Also he gets beaten pretty much all the time. There are only 3'ish exceptions where he shows real emotions. And again.. shoddy pacing cripples them slightly.The Second character, his friend - Katey (i think).. she was fine. She was active and I couldn't shake this feeling that she's the brains of the team with witty humor, while he's broody muscle man with past.There were few amazing scenes, which i loved alot, really. But beyond that it was just mediocre. Thank god it was ""just"" mediocre, considering what things marvel relases lately. Mediocre is fine. Really. Tiresome, extended to the point of exhausting... But fine! A (not so) solid 7!Oh also, there are quite a few plot holes and whatnot ranging from minor (assassins using stun weapons ONLY - lol) to extreme (spoilery stuff).. but at this point.. i just can't even bother. Just roll my eyes and force my brain to stop thinking about it. To become a script writer in 202x all you need to know is how to sniff glue with class and how to agree to everything corporate monkeys in expensive suits tell you.Should you watch it? If Marvel fan.. you already seen it. If you aren't marvel fan, but still enjoy sci-fi/fantasy... Eh... Not like there's anything better to do I guess."
"The action and camera work in particular, along with the cast were very impressive! What I didn't like about it though were just a couple of throw-away nuisance characters and some of the weird humor. Other than that, I'd say it's worth a watch! Plus, it was good seeing some old Marvel faces!"
"Loved it all. The comedy, the story, the acting, the special effects. A new character of Marvel with a lot of potencial. Hope to see a lot more of this in next movies."
"Shang-Chi is fantastic, it's like a Bruce Lee movie meets a Marvel movie. One of the better Marvel movies. I love that they brought back Ben Kingsley to play Trevor, which he was one of my favorite characters in this movie and it is fixing his character as the Mandarin in Iron Man 3. I love that Ben Kingsley knows that most people didn't like him as the Mandarin. The insistence Planet of the Apes is played by real Monkeys is hilarious. I love the Mandarin in this movie he was my favorite character in this movie besides, Morris, Morris is the best character ever. Morris is great. The Mandarin in this movie is one of my favorite Marvel villains ever. The Ten Rings are very interesting. The bus scene at the beginning is awesome. The opening scene was also quite good. The fighting and the choreography is very well done. The dragons are very cool looking and them fighting was cool. It was nice to see Wong in this and it was nice to see him fight the Abomination. The action scenes are really cool and Simu Liu is great as Shang-Chi. I really like his character a lot and his acting is quite good. I really like the plot, it is simple but I really enjoyed it. Meng' er Zhang is good as Xialing as well. My biggest flaw is Awkwafina, she isn't as bad in this as she was in Raya and the Last Dragon and she is funny in this some of the time but I just don't think I like her very much. It will be cool to see Shang-Chi return in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. I really enjoyed this and it was one of the better Marvel movies."
"It was fun, beautiful, and different. Very watchable and rewatchable which is an important quality in action movies. Go see it while it's in the theater because it is a pretty set film best seen on the big screen."
"The best aspects of this movie is hand to hand combats(without the rings) and Simu Liu is awesome in it and embraces the character. The story is good if consider standalone which it is but I have problems with other aspects of movie elements. The entire movie is shooted in closed studio environment with huge set pieces (Marvel is doing such things for last many movies e.g, the last 2 Avengers movies). It is very very very stupid to look at and the non sensical vfx. Still remember the first Iron man movie in which the original and vfx elements are hard to distinguish and have had a good balance in reality and fantasy world. The movie is forcing the humours too in some cases. In some case they tried to mimic Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. This movie certainly have some asian vibe in movie making style but I think there were manipulation in making by studio over creator. The music of the movie is good. Overall it's a good movie. I am going to give any special attention for other upcoming marvel movies( Maybe because I left behind my fantasy world). I think there will not be any 'Classic' from marvel in upcoming future."
"Shang-Chi is a character I and many others, know very little about. Which in Marvels case offers up a clean slate to tell a fresh story. I'm happy to say they have delivered. Marvel's newest outing is a Kung-Fu superhero extravaganza, that is fully built on it's action and set pieces. The performances of Simu Liu and Tony Leung stand out amongst the pack and offer a great and rich story for Marvels Cinematic Universe. Though the film can at times feel bogged down by its origin story tropes, the direction of Destin Daniel Cretton, the overall charm of its cast, and story make the film feel fresh and lively. I'm happy to welcome this crew to the ever growing MCU and cannot wait to see what comes next. Hopefully more Shang-Chi!"
"I finally took the plunge and went to cinema for the first time since 2019. The movie was highly entertaining with engaging characters and a good story too. The action and fights scenes seemed very well choreographed and the special effects were a joy to experience on the big screen.It was a Marvel film that didn't feel like a Marvel film, which shows how versatile the MCU is becoming.I was highly impressed to see and hear characters speak in their native language, a risk as many people don't like to read subtitles, but being an avid fan of Asian cinema I was quite happy and comfortable to do so.Overall, a highly entertaining and fun film from Marvel.I highly recommend it. A+++"
"""Reel Tunez: The Radio Show All About the Movies"" Movie Review (9/8/21): ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings""First, when people on IMDB rate a movie (though VERY good) a 9 or 10, I really want to ask ""So it's a 10.. the VERY BEST movie EVER.. as good as ""Sound of Music"", ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Oliver"", ""Star Wars"" and movies that probably DO get a 9 or 10?? To me.. YES.. an excellent movie. But people skew the ratings by calling everything a 9 or 10. With that said, I'd give it between a 7 and 8 (which is VERY good), but a little closer to a 7 (7.4).Yet another Marvel Studio (Disney) release to the Marvel Universe. I knew nothing about this movie and didn't really have a lot of interest in seeing it, but GLAD I did! It was fun.. and it was exciting! Excellent adventure movie that had great effects and great story line.If you like adventure movies.. even if you haven't followed the Marvel Universe, you really don't have to know the history of the other movies to enjoy this one.I will add the following (which is not a spoiler): Do NOT leave the movie until the very VERY last of the credits have rolled and they turn on the lights to clean the place. As the movie ends, we go into one last restaurant scene. Then in the middle of the credits, we get MORE story. Then after the last of the credits.. even after ""Marvel Studio Cleaning Crew: Bob the Janitor and Mae his wife"", we get ONE more scene at the end. These Marvel extras are consistent and basically a clue into what comes next.On a 1-10 scaled, I'd give this a very good 7.4! This is a BIG screen movie, so see it at the theater."
"Really nice concept with great Direction, teams work & VFX. I really enjoy the movie ü§ó"
"I've been a Marvel fan for a long time now and I must say this is Black Panther level impressive. A great origin story, great characters and visual effects and of course the action. Any Marvel's fan will absolutely love it and if you're new to the scene this is a great start."
"Its was great, finally after so long we got to experience good origins story. I know kevin feige will nailed it even after lot of people thought its gonna flop.The movie is like a mixture between western and eastern culture afterall the protagonist is an asian living in american.The raw choreography is the best in the MCU, better than Winter Soldier. The CGI fights is not bad but i think they should do more of the raw realistic fight scene more because its the most appealing part of the movie.Tony Leung is so charismatic even if he is a villain, i can feel sympathetic to his character. The new mythology is cool, the fantastic beast is awesome too
I hope we can see a sequels."
"As an Asian-American, I am no stranger to the cliche martial art scenes and corniness of it all. I went in fully expecting everything about this movie to be cheesy and cliche like Mulan was. Boy, was I wrong! Shang-Chi was so beautifully written, acted, and directed! I really want to give a huge shout out to the directors for their incorporation of Asian culture into this movie without making everything a cliche or a punch-line. I teared up watching people who looked like me be the main actors on a big screen and not the punch-line of a joke.Now, onto the story, the story was alright. It wasn't the best, but it's an introductory movie to the hero so not much to expect there other than your typical hero introductory tropes.The OST's of this movie were off the charts! I really enjoyed the music they had and think they nailed it.Need I say more about the acting? Tony Leung, Sima Liu, Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh...These are the best of the best for Asian American actors and they nailed every scene they had in the movie!Lastly, I absolutely loved the cinematography and the fight scenes. They were well thought out and choreographed. It didn't seem cheesy or corny. Thank you Marvel for making this movie and paying homage to Asian Americans. This movie will be one that I will never forget!"
"All I can say is ""wow"". I loved the cinematography, I was amazed by the choreography and the fact it wasn't hidden or obscured through camera angles like some previous movies, and I now love Simu Liu and think he is an incredible addition to the MCU, along with Awkwafina.The ""villain"" of the story, Wenwu, played by the amazing Tony Leung, had incredible character depth and was certainly not a stereotypical bad guy.Aside from a couple of awkward phrases, I loved everything about this movie and am so glad I was able to support it during their opening weekend. If it wasn't COVID, I would've went to see it again by now. Highly recommend."
"Today I watched the movie ""Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings."" Overall I quite enjoyed it, but there are a few things I believe could have been done better.First of all there are the characters. Shang Chi himself I believe was lacking when it came to his personality. Both Xialing and Katy had traits that were simple, interesting, and easy to follow. Throughout the film Shang Chi goes from being a less extreme version of Katy to a less extreme version of Xialing. This causes him to be forgettable, as there is a more interesting character with the same personality in the film at all times. It would have been nice to see some of his own traits that are unique and fresh.I think the development of the main heroes could have been more evenly spread across the whole film, as the only noticeable changes I witnessed were after they had reached the village.I think it is also important to talk about Shang Chi's father. He was a very three dimensional character and I really enjoyed his interactions with his son during their final fight. The only thing I would have liked to change about him would be to see him be affected by his old age, surely being around for so long would give him some sort of wisdom. Something that confused me was whether or not he was supposed to be redeemed in the end, as the way other characters felt about him was very inconsistent. While this could have been a fun concept to explore, seeing how his children felt about him and how unsure they were, it was not done correctly. Their feelings changed quickly and it was not shown to us enough for it to be something the audience recognised.The next thing I would like to talk about are the rings. They were confusing, inconsistent, and not explored enough. The abilities the rings possessed were not clear. In one scene Xu Wenwu will take down an army, then lose to one woman. Though she was aided by her powers, many of the moves Xu Wenwu showed during the opening could have been used in many other situations during the film. The rings are built up to be something that can grant you god like powers, but they end up being underwhelming. It does not make sense that Xu Wenwu is not able to take down the Ta Lo army. The people of Ta Lo possess abilities granted to them by the great protector but these powers are never explained or shown. While not all things have to be explained, this movie had too many questions left unanswered. While the after credits scene alluded to an explanation of the rings' origins, I am looking at this movie as a standalone project. None of the magic is given an explanation, that includes the rings and the great protector.My third point will be the plot and the execution of the whole film. The plot was not well done. Many of the points were rushed and introduced very out of nowhere. These points include the introduction of Trevor and Morris. It was a little too convenient that they met someone who just happened to live with something from Ta Lo, and just happened to be able to understand it, and was also willing to help them. Another thing would be the exposition. A few times during this film I felt as if a book was being read to me. There are better ways to tell a backstory than for a character to tell it to us directly. The death of Shang Chi's mother also seemed very random. It seemed as if it was not thought about at all. The gang that killed her was never mentioned before, and they were nor important to the plot in any way, so much so that they were shown to be killed not much after. I also feel it would have been better for Shang chi and his friends to stay in Ta Lo for longer until his father shows up. This is because it would give Katy time to learn about the bow and arrow much more realistically.The climax, which would be when the dweller in darkness appears. The dweller is, like the rings, built up to be something very powerful and ends up being underwhelming. Everything slightly before and after this was rushed, such as the introduction of the gate, which, like many things, was shown through a voice over. It had not been shown before this and we were not given the time to actually think about the dangers it may possess. The appearance of the great protector was also very random and, again, underwhelming.Lastly, the ending. It also made no sense for Shang Che to be able to defeat the dweller that easily, as his father, who had a thousand years to master them, was not able to. If he was also aided by the power of the dragon, this should have been stated. I do think the scene of everyone honoring the dead was done well, and was important for showing how much was sacrificed during the battle.Many of the problems I talked about could have been fixed with better timing, the right foreshadowing, better exposition, and more consistency. All in all I really enjoyed this film, though that may seem a little contradictory with how much I criticised it. I would recommend this film for anyone who enjoys cool action and cool visuals, also if you're looking for fun female characters. I would rate this movie a 7/10."
"As a huge fan of the IP Man and Marvel movies I feel that this movie was a beautiful balance between insane action and beautiful backdrops and wonderful mystical powers. Growing up watching old-school kung fu movies and then finding superhero movies on my own and loving them, I feel this movie is a perfect blend of everything I want from modern action cinema."
"This film is full of surprises, and really perfect."
"Watched it yesterday. Overall the movie was wonderful. MCU put everything so perfectly. The cast, visuals, CGI everything was on pinpoint. Every Characters performance was brilliant. I need to mention this because without this character the movie would not be that interesting and that role is played by Awkwafina as Katy. Her comic timing was so good. And as always marvel surprised me to have the villain as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung as as Xu Wenwu. His performance was brilliant along with our new hero Simu Liu as Shang Chi.Definitely worth of time. Go watch the movie in the theatre and don't spoil."
"What a great flick. The action was amazing throughout, constantly growing and changing so the fights never got boring. Awkwafina is a favourite of mine and did a great job. Family relationships really do make the most compelling of stories. We got an Antagonist that had a tragic and understandable story, he never felt 1 dimensional like so many other hero rising villains."
"Shang-Chi was BEYOND my expectations. Some of the best acting, fight choreography, and visual effects I've seen from Marvel in a while. The story itself had so much heart."
"This movie is fabulous..
Writings for every character was brilliant. Action sequences were beyon my imagination..Worth watching...Phrase 4 begins with a blast."
"I went into this hoping for fresh ideas but with low expectations and BOY was I surprised. This film was amazing! The casting, script, acting and everything else in between. Marvel really smashed this."
"The Cinema Was On Fire, I think It was Partly to do with Katy and Her Crazy Energy. And Also That Bus Fight Scene Was Incredible, it really got things going.It's A Very Funny Movie too, Laughs Were Coming From The Audience Frequently. It Was Such a Great Time.Good Story, Amazing Visuals, Good Comedy, Some Nice Fights.Also The Ten Rings in Action Were Spectacular To Watch. The Ten Rings Are Brutal.It's A Major World Event For the Official Start Of the New MCU (Black Widow is a Prequel).Overall, As A Movie It is Probably An 8 Out Of 10 but Because of the Cinematic Experience, that Changes the Game Completely. It Was A Major Cinematic Experience. 10 Stars üåü For The Ten Rings üìÄ"
Another amazing Marvel film with awesome visual effects. I think they did a great job blending Asian culture within film. Give me more second-tier Marvel characters.
"If you are a fan of the character, you will love it, marvel is opening up to new realms and its going to be intense... next up eternals let's go!!!"
Can't wait to see what else is to come from Shang Chi.Fantastic from start to finish!Well worth the watch.
"This movie is a blast and then some. It is, just like Black Panther was, a Marvel movie and it's own thing at the same time. It brings a much needed freshness to MCU. The story is about Shang-Chi, a Kung Fu fighter, who is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. Is this the same Ten Rings organization from Iron Man and Iron Man 3? I'll let the movie explain.Director Destin Daniel Cretton successfully blends in his culture in the Marvel format, but also keeps it real, authentic and most importantly communicates a very personal story effectively. At the heart of it, this is a movie about a dysfunctional family dealing with their family drama. I'm not going to talk about what the drama is as that will be a spoiler. But with that drama comes some of the best Kung-Fu fights I've seen on the big screen in a long time.Simu Liu as Shang-Chi and Awkwafina as his best friend are well known stars, but after this movie they will be upgraded to superstar status. They were brilliant in the movie and were yin to each other's yang. Where Simu Liu brought the punches, Awkwafina brought. The punchlines. They complimented each other to create the perfect balance. Another character that left an impression on me is Tony Chiu-Wai Leung as Shang-Chi's father. The love-hate relationship between him and Shang-Chi is relatable and just so heartbreaking.Rest of the star cast is also brilliantly casted and this movie has some of the best written supporting characters. The core group consists of Fala Chen as Shang-Chi's mother who is the soul of this movie, Meng'er Zhang as his sister who is just as much of a kick ass as Shang-Chi and Michelle Yeoh as his aunt who becomes his guide and teacher. There is also a surprise character in the movie that I loved, but I am not going to talk about it and spoil it for you guys.This is a Marvel product so you know that the VFX & CGI are industry best. Adding to that are the beautiful Cinematography and the fast paced Camera Work. Each and every fight sequence is meticulously handled and spectacularly choreographed. You have seen some of the bus fight scenes in the trailer, but there are other high stake fight scenes that will also leave you breathless.You knew you were going to watch this movie when it came out. My review is just to tell you that yes, it is everything you expected and wanted it to be. I personally never doubted Kevin Feige. Now go watch this movie and let it knock your socks off.P. S. - This movie has a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene, so make sure you catch those."
"Absolutely fantastic! Just don't miss it on big screen, i'd say. Moderation of comedy punches, action and katy has my üíïheart! Superb!!!!!!"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it was so awesome. Definitely recommend seeing it in the theater. Watch through the credits, there's two Post-Credit Scenes!"
"I can't express to you how amazingly beautiful this movie is. You need to watch it for yourself! Excellently choreography, awesome blend of humor, drama and action. I was beginning to think there was no place for martial artists in marvel after iron fist, I was proved wrong. Hopefully we get several more üëçüëç"
Awesome fights.Awesome graphics.Awesome music.Awesome üëç movie.Music & fight sequences are the best.Personally second best solo hero movie of Marvel after Ironman.
Great story and it's totally worth seeing it was one of the best marvel movies i have ever seen.
This movie is very amazing. The special effect and martial arts stunt are very beautiful. This is one the best movie from Marvel. A must to see the movie 2 times.
"The movie was so in point - from the standard parent reference around doing better, around the typical girls and boys can't be friends they must get married at some point the the we can be responsible orrrrrr...Honestly - this has hit me on another level with how relative to our culture it is! So well done - so authentic to marvel!!! And it's just the beginning!!!!!!!!"
"What do you call a man on a mission to keep his family safe? What do you call a man who just wants to fit in where he belongs? A new kind of hero. We have entered into Phase 4 of the greatest movie franchise in movie history. We have seen battles, we have seen so many Marvel characters in the last 12 years come to life, but this new kind of hero comes to us by surprise.Who here knows about Shang-Chi? I just learned about on Friday and from what I read - I can honestly tell you his story is one for the history books. I can't give out the whole movie to you or anything to spoil the movie, but this movie was different from the other movies in the MCU.I was in shock from the very beginning to the end, there were a lot of ""easter eggs"" linking all the way back to Tony Stark, oops, I think I said a little too much, but I will say this -
This movie defied everything in the natural and supernatural realm of not only the physical, but the soul. It dives deep into the soul of a person, and that is what Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is all about.I have to give a huge shout-out to Simu Liu - like I said before - I have never heard of Shang-Chi up until recently, but he gave the role a new meaning and a new identity.Now without giving too much away, with every Marvel movie, there are some credit scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat. That's all I am saying.So in essence - I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: 11 stars."
The MCU is getting out of it's repetitive train of movies with an all new Asian epic inspiring a new generation!
"One of my favourite marvel movies, can't get over how good it was. Simu Liu ( Shang-chi himself) did such an amazing job along with the rest of the cast."
"The story telling, the act of Tony Leung, the Chinese elements this time are really authentic and didn't make me feel weird for I believe the very first time from watching the Hollywood movie, whether it's the creatures, family relationships, even the language speaking this time is really legit. This is such a great movie."
I went to the cinema with 0 hype and i get impressed.
"Amazing visuals, phenomenal fight choreography and a genuinely interesting story. I never knew about the character before but Shang Chi has already become a favourite of mine. I really hope he shows up in Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness."
"After a brief gap of theatrical release (not considering Black Widow as it had a partial release), MARVEL is back in theatres introducing to the characters of the new phase of their universe. Shang Chi The Legend Of Ten Rings is a standalone film but equally also serves as an important piece of puzzle in the events linking to the web series' and upcoming movies. It goes without saying that watching all the recently released series on Disney+ is as important as following these movies in order.As the trailer shows and also the name suggests Shang Chi is a movie whose action heavily lean towards the martial arts and individual battles. It is a different watch as compared to other MARVEL movies which involve a lot of hi tech dependent action. The movie hardly wastes any time on the lead character's introduction and straightway jumps into the 'purpose'. Having experienced the 'blip' after the infinity war, the normal people aren't surprised anymore when supernatural things and high octane action happens around them. Hence the character here is hardly wasting any time on hiding their identities from the public. The storyline is pretty straightforward and the movie has strong resemblance to Black Panther because of the lead character's connection to his place of origin. The action sequences are shot brilliantly and some of the camera and lighting work is mind blowing. The movie relies on good hand to hand combat almost until the climax and I believe if MARVEL had gone for an R rating, the action sequences would have been much better to watch. I personally think some incidents happening around climax were way too convenient. Last but not the least, the background music just elevates most scenes into a whole new level.Simu Liu has what it takes to bring the Asian heritage to the superhero universe. The movie doesn't test much of his emotional side and I believe we will get to see more in the upcoming movies. Tony Leung shines in his powerful antagonist role and Awkwafina drives the comical side of things as Shang Chi's close buddy who is almost a sidekick. Rest of the cast have done a decent job and do look out for a surprise funny cameo ;-)MARVEL expands its universe with Shang Chi by exploring a different culture and heritage in the superhero genre. It is a satisfying watch for a MARVEL fan and a great watch for any action movie fans."
"I was blown away by the great storyline from start to finish, amazing choreography, stunning visuals, and surreal locales. It's happy, it's sad, it's funny, it's touching. It knows when to be serious and knows when to be hilarious. The blend between the classic Asian traditions and the modern world was a definite bonus. Plus, it focuses on a blend between mythical and natural. Besides that, it ties into the MCU seamlessly. The movie thankfully explains a connection between the faux Ten Rings in the Iron Man movies and the actual Ten Rings. I also enjoyed all of the Easter eggs. This movie was worth the wait."
Visually stunning. Awesome fight scenes. Many Easter Eggs.
This was a great movie. I really enjoyed it from start to finish.
"The movie was very good, especially the soundtrack!! It was unique unlike other marvel movies which has a generic soundtrack. Highly recommend yall watch this in theaters."
"I was never a fan of the Shang-Chi comic book, but this movie was very refreshing and amazing. Great introduction to Shang-Chi! Simu Liu is perfectly well casted. There was great chemistry between the leads, and the fight choreography is the best I've ever seen from Marvel. Great story line and action, and especially the comedy!!! Loved Awkwafina!! I can't give it 8 or 9 stars. I GIVE it a 10 star rating! Highly recommended! Watch it and you won't be disappointed."
"Good film. There were some places that seemed superfluous or unnecessary, but this did not affect the fact that the film is wonderful!"
So Shang chi has an evil Kung fu father with sci Fi bracelets and an air bender mother. He leaves his father behind to pursue a simpler chilled life in Sam Francisco and then they the fathers organization attacks him and brings him back to have him help and get to his mothers home village. In the village he fights his father and wins and then fights anime looking monsters which are like dementors/ soul suckers. He gets help from a water bending dragon and defeats the king monster by performing an exorcism with his bracelets. Acting wasn't amazing but let's all appreciate how cool Morris was. Probably the best character in the movie.
I thought this movie was long. 2 hrs 12 min. Felt more like 2.5-3 hrs. I was ok at first but as it went on I got bored and couldn't believe it felt so long. There were other people laughing and enjoying his side-kick comedy. It was all too 13 yr. Oldish for me. Not a bad movie but NOT a 8.1 tho. 5-6. AVERAGE.
That movie was So good that my blood celly wanted see this masterpiece on they're own And my nose started bleeding in the Middle of the final fight.
"First marvel film with an asian lead are you ready hell yeah. First seeing the trailer thought it will be a good film but turns out i love it to the core. This film has all the elements humor, fighting, acting all done right. The main thing that attracts me is that the movie didn't waste a single minute in any other things. Fully focused on the plot and nothing else. Things got me wow is fight between wong and abomination and after the fight discussion between them and also the fighting choreography and cinematography were too good that i can't take my eyes of for a second. And most of all it's not the kind of the other family stories it different in many way. So that's it enjoy the movie see it in theaters if you have a chance. Stay safe....And don't miss the post credits there is real surprise waiting."
"I've seen it in cinemas about an hour ago, I was very impressed :)."
"Clearly only people working for the film have rated it high.. Trust me don't wast your time or money, its 2hrs ill never get back.. Acting was terrible, only decent thing about the film was the special effects...."
"The plot twist with Ben Kingsley and what looks like a mop head is so so bad, film takes a nose dive after that, why? Who thought that would be good."
"I was expecting fun Marvel movie, instead i got some random kung-fu movie with superhero i have never heard of. So bad."
"Shang Chi and the legend of the ten rings introduces a new Marvel Character/Avenger, and that's Shang-Chi. The way that the film introduced that character was great. Loved how the film jumps back and forth a few times to tell us about Shang-Chi's past when he was young and how or why he ended up where he is in the present day.The film had so many fight scenes that were amazing and the cinematography that was used to shoot these fight scenes made them 10x better and that's perhaps because the cinematographer of this film is Bill Pope who shot The Matrix (1999) and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 (2004). You could tell for sure that there are a lot of similarities between the fight scenes in Shang-Chi and The Matrix especially that both of them had this ""kung fu"" style of fighting. Loved how sometimes during the fight scenes the ""Dutch tilt"" method was used and it was wide showing the stunning set design around.The film is also visually stunning which I'm happy to call one of Marvel's most visually stunning films. It's a treat for the eyes.The comedy in the film was so good and used very carefully in perfect times which is something that scares me whenever I watch a ""Marvel"" film. Because these films are supposed to be ""serious superhero"" films. But, when comedy is used in perfect times, the result will be perfect.Akwafina's acting was very great. Loved her character and am excited to see what her character will have in future MCU Films. Simu Liu was of course the perfect actor for this role but one thing that in my opinion he ""failed at"" are the ""emotional scenes"". This film has so many emotional scenes that discuss ""family"" and the relationship between a father and his son. I felt like Simu Liu couldn't be able to deliver that emotional feeling to the audience because his acting was bad in these emotional scenes. This brings me to Tony Chiu-Wai Leung who plays ""the father"". Leung carried the whole film in my opinion. Whenever there was an emotional scene between the father and his son, Leung was way better at expressing and showing his feelings than Simu Liu.Loved all the visual effects, they were all well made especially that the film has so many. The customs as well are great and loved how sometimes the colors represent Shang-Chi's culture like the ""football varsity jacket"" that was red and grey that Shang-Chi was wearing at the beginning of the film.I got to point out that the last 30 minutes or so of the film are one of the greatest and most enjoyable in the whole MCU.My rating is 8/10."
... but the previews ruined every single plot point.When will they learn??
"Great combination of high energy action, emotional context, and funny. It was a great introduction to these characters. Looking forward to seeing them more!"
Quite a lot of representation and it is great that they are trying to expand Marvel's repetoire. Main character could have been casted a little better.
"How incredible sad is to watch Modern Marvel Disappoint Second time in a Row. Obviously it wont even go over 350 Million Worldwide. Boring, generic movie, would have been better as Streaming movie, then some people would at least watch it and maybe react to it on youtube, because that's where most of Suicide Squad popularity came. Wont happen with this movie tho, because nobody can watch it on streaming and nobody cares that much about this movie to go to cinema. Maybe hardcore marvel fans will, but most people wont."
"The simple, well choreographed fights were FAR better than any CGI battle-mess which unfortunately took over the movie in the 3rd act. Decent characters and mediocre at-BEST lore make this a forgettable entry into the MCU."
Another very mediocre movie from this dying 'universe' but some fight scenes are quite good and visual it's mostly ok too. Better than Capt Marvel. Hence the two points.
"Not that I expect coherent storylines from Disney, but good grief, this film was a mess. It's all over the place!Here's a little tip for the people who wrote this: pick a tone and stick with it!Good CGI and very good action set pieces. Hence three stars instead of one. Other than that - this is the normal generic Marvel phase 2 dross.Oh, and Awkwafina is unwatchable! She's more like an irritant than an actress.P. S. I'm incredibly suspicious of the o.t.t. Positive reviews this film is getting on here. Bots?"
"I decided to go in blind to this movie and I loved every thing about this movie it's humour, acting and it's characters but most of all the fight scenes
GO AND WATCH THIS MOVIE."
"When I thought this is just another marvel movies, Shang-Chi is beyond my expectation!"
"I'm super happy to say that Marvels newest movie outing, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", is a hilarious, action packed, CGI thrill ride and it's a fantastic one at that. After seeing ""Black Widow"" I was worried that Marvel/Disney had started shifting their focus to their very ambitious TV mini series projects and left the quality of their movies behind. I'm now confident that isn't the case. Here, sets, visuals, costumes, choreography, score, acting and directing are all top notch. Each shot feels fresh and visually stunning. Each joke and emotion land. And the action is amazing. The first big set piece involving Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) and his best friend (awkwafina), is a bus ride to work gone horribly wrong, it hooks you instantly and has you either in awe with its incredible fight choreography or laughing at the perfectly timed jokes. It really doesn't let up in either category going forward. I can't believe how much I loved the pairing of these characters, their choice to not make it romantic and I love how different and real they feel from other characters in the MCU. Often Marvels problem has been their reliance on the same personality traits for their heroes, funny jerks with over confidence or bumbling idiots thrust into power. Here the main character is naturally a good person, hes comfortable with being himself and with his best friend, when power comes to him he accepts, he never truly stops being him, he doesn't have to learn a lesson, he just rolls with the punches. Almost all of this goes to actor Simu Liu who brings an extra dose of likability to the role, along with the chemistry he shares with Awkwafina which makes their friendship believable. There's even great references, cameos and credit scenes for the fans looking for that. Of course there are problems, the biggest is the big CGI slug fest ending that plagues these types of films, when all it truly needed to do was be smaller. It's a mess of CGI at times and feels a little too big and too rushed. Characters just instantly know and understand things and accept everything with ease. It is easy to over look all this, with how much fun you'll have."
Wow what a stinker! Who wanted this movie made? Who are they that this movie was made for? Clearly NOT China as they won't allow it to be shown in their country. Just another boring MCU movie. Probably was worth more than a 1 star but all those 9 and 10 star ratings are undeserved. I'd recommend waiting till this is free on your Disney+ subscription without paying their ridiculous mark up of $30. It's worth waiting for! Definitely NOT worth going to the theater and paying your hard earned money to see it.
The Marvel Studios once again makes a movie that uses jokes instead of making a good character development.
"It was an okay movie. Simu Liu is the son of the seemingly immortal master of the Ten Rings --always good to see Tony Leung, and I hope he soaked Disney --who winds up opposing his dad, and Awkwafina is his slacker sort-of girlfriend. They are fine in the leads, as is Meng'er Zhang as his sister, and Michelle Yeoh as their aunt -- always good to see her, and I hope she soaked Disney too.I have grown increasingly fond of martial arts films over the last couple of decades, and the decline of the movie musical is the reason why. They don't make movies like that any more, and when they try, they're often embarrassing. People don't like the unreality of people bursting out into song, or expressing their emotions through dance. No, they prefer the solid commonplace of people floating through space to kick each other in the head. To me, the fight choreography is its own dance, and the fight between Leung and Fala Chen when they meet and before they fall in love is a challenge dance as graceful as any between Astaire and Rogers.There are problems aplenty with this film. There's an immense amount of exposition, starting off with twenty minutes of it in Chinese. I'm not sure why Ben Kingsley as the fake 'Mandarin' from IRON MAN 3 is present except for a certain remnant of star power and connecting this to the rest of the MCU. Still, with my expectations not set particularly high, I had a good time."
"I Love Shang-Chi!, This is Amazing Marvel Superhero Asian Movie, The Ten Ring Reference Showing in Iron Man 1,2 and 3, Marvel One Shot & Ant-Man, Mandiri Character was Amazing has Previously on Iron Man 3, And Visual Fighting So Awesome!! (Also Including Abomination & Wong)Rating: 9/10."
"Absolutely loved it. Must watch. Non stop action and all you can imagine in a good movie....
I am not saying any more, just watch the film and you will not be disappointed.I think I will go to the cinema at least one more time to watch it again, that how great it was.I am simply buzzing!!!"
"It's so amazing to see more Asian and female representation of films - this film is a representation of Marvel's ability to adapt, adapt to different cultures, languages, race. That they are able to create new story lines, but also branch them together. I have to say, amazing cast too! I can't wait to see what else Marvel has to bring out, I hope other studios take inspiration and follow suit. People enjoy different yet relatable, and this film didn't disappoint!"
"I was super excited for this film and at the start of the year it was probably my most anticipated film of the year. It definitely did not disappoint me! This film is massive fun, massive action and has massive heart. The action scenes are so cool and the choreography is amazing in the fight scenes and the martial arts look so good. I love the jokes between the two main characters and the banter they have together is great fun. This is a good way to do an origin film this far into the MCU, it sort of flicks between flash backs and the present day and it keeps the pacing of the film fresh and quick. Shang-chi as a character isn't super well known but just like the guardians of the galaxy I think he will become a household name. The shots in this film are gorgeous at times and have some beautiful bright colours and amazing Chinese settings. Some of the effects fail a little bit but it's not enough to harm the film at all. I loved this film and I'm so happy to be back into the marvel universe once again!"
"Probably the best MCU origin movie since Gaurdians. Great martial arts action too. No shaky cam! The fight scenes are reminiscent if the older Jackie Chan movies of the 90s, which makes sense since his choreographer and crew worked on this movie."
"It's unbelievably unbelievable that Marvel went over the top with the chinese culture fantasy myth even tho it is too much even for the asian community. Nevertheless I will appreciate it and absorb it because the fight scenes are visually stunning and the choreography was exceptional. Fantastic VFX, SFX and CGI you can see all the details on Imax. My only issue is the execution of the good Dragon - it's too Raya the Last Dragon meaning it's too Disney more than MCU vibe. Also, I wish I didn't watch all the too many trailers of the movie cuz you lose the surprise. The 2 post credits tho - it's fun and insane!"
"This had so much potential that got sadly wasted.The few fight scenes in the first half were better in quality compared to the usual Marvel quick cut edited ones. They were mildly reminiscent of the Matrix fights( The intro to the Shangchi theme music even sounded suspiciously similar to Furious Angels from Matrix Reloaded and made me miss the Matrix films more)However, anything positive about the film ends in the first half only with the second half culminating in a bloated CGI mess that is the hallmark of almost all Marvel movies. In fact, between Shangchi and Black Widow, I'd say the latter featured much better visual effects which would have looked better on the big screen than this. Shangchi would have been a more apt as a direct to video release.)It didn't also help that the lead actor was a complete void of charisma.Honestly, I am just going to watch some Jackie Chan movies now to now to help deal with the kung fu cravings this movie initiated in me but failed to deliver."
I have already watch this movie three times this movie was awesome. It had everything from action to comedy and the really embraced the Chinese culture in this movie. But I was more excited for the post credit scene and I think we have not seen the last of shang chi.
I just finished watching this and all i can say is this movie is soo unique. From the action to the atmosphere it just made this experience so great words can't even explain. I'm so eager to see what marvel has in store for us next!
"Usually I write a lot more in these reviews. I'm a 'see it on the first showing' for every Marvel movie and series - and this has left me without any superlatives. Amazing, 10/10."
"Love everything the visuals,nature, action, acting everything on point
Best Superhero movie of the year he'll yes
New fav avenger Shang-chi."
"The fighting scenes were amazing, especially the intro and the ending."
"What a breath of fresh air this film is, it's doesn't feel like your traditional Marvel film till the end scene, mid and end credit scene.Visually beautiful the creatures and scenery. The action was fast paced and blows you away.Can't fault this film, you walk out the cinema and could easily walk back in and watch it again."
"This movie is not for everyone.I would like to preface this by saying that I was really thrilled to have an Asian superhero on the big screen. The trailers looked fantastic and I was hoping Marvel/Disney could supplement the visuals and fight choreographies with a good storyline well set into the preexisting MCU.Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed.The visuals are stunning as expected. The fight scenes are great too. But the story is a mixed bag.It starts off as a family drama between Shang-Chi, his father and his sister. That would all be good and indeed it was, I really enjoyed the first half or so of the movie. Even despite the main villain (or supposedly the main one at that point in the story) being a bit bland in my opinion, certainly for a 1000-year-old conqueror and mastermind wielding incredibly powerful artifacts of unknown origin (sidenote: the rings turn out to not do much beside being hurled at enemies like projectiles with cool light effects; in other words their powers are really not explored or represented well at all).The second half (when they discover the mystical village) is when things go absolutely bonkers. If the story kept revolving around the family of the protagonist, it would be all good. But for whatever reason someone decided to throw a complete oddball into the movie in a form of soul-eating demons (?) which, without much explanation or backstory (the only thing we know about them is that they exist), instantly assume the role of the main bad against whom everyone (including the previous main villain and his henchmen) must fight. At this point I was just sitting there amazed by the visuals and absolutely confused by what was actually happening as I wasn't sure if the main fight was Shang-Chi against his dad, Shang-Chi against the soul-eating demon, The Great Protector dragon against the demon, Shang-Chi, his sister and his friend Katy against the demon...you get the point.The camoes of other MCU characters also felt forced. Wong was fighting Abomination, sure, but why? We never find out and it's hinted that they are actually pals. Does that mean Secretary Ross just occasionally misplaces Abomination for friendly sparring with a sorcerer then? Captain Marvel and Bruce Banner also appear, briefly examining the rings which apparently have some kind of a beacon in them. Again, completely out of nowhere but perhaps a promise for the next movie where we might actually find our what the hell is going on with these things (which again seem only as a collection of cool deadly mini frisbees in the movie).Am I glad that I went to watch it in a cinema? Yes. Do I think the character has a lot of potential for the future movies? Absolutely. But as of right now, Shang-Chi has been one of the most underwhelming introductions of a new superhero within the MCU to date."
"First I had some concerns just about the fact that Shang Chi is a complete new carachter we never met before and new surroundings. Well this movie is an emotional rollercoaster, worked out beautiful, with just the exact humor, great actors, very detailled fightscenes. And besides the story is very beautiful, it's about getting justice for their lost mom. And this makes it BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL."
"A refreshing return to theatre going normalcy! The movie feels different from the previous Marvel movies and while I had low to no expectations from this movie, I was Iron Man'ed into falling in love with this movie and the character that AI formerly knew little about. The action was awesome the visuals both practical and CG were awesome and the story wasn't over complicated or too simple. Saw it with friends and we enjoyed it start to finish. Simu Liu and Awkwafina have great chemistry and Tony Leung Chiu-wai is very relatable and relatable as a villain and person. Over all I love the movie the most for feeling both down to earth and human while also being full Marvel wonder. Like Iron Man, the way it opens a wide and beautiful future for Marvel leaves me optimistic and excited."
Awesome movie... To be honest one of the best marvel solo films everrr....
"Don't believe the praise for this movie. Marvel fans who liked it have got to be kidding. They always trash DC movies but they liked this? I don't get it. But then that is typical coming from Marvel fans. It is not the Shang Chi I remember from the 70's comics. It would have been better if It took place in the 70's and had more of an Enter The Dragon vibe. What we get is anything but. It has some good action scenes, the best being with Shang fighting men on a bus. But then it has Ben Kingsley who was out of place in it and a furry creature called Morris that was stupid and unnecessary and should have been ommitted from the movie. It's like a furry pig with wings with no head or face that makes sounds like an Ewok or Gizmo from Gremlins. So dumb. There are some amusing moments but then I find it irritating that something funny has to be thrown in at odd moments. Like most Marvel films. Give it a break. Please. The ending is something out of a Rodan, Godzilla movie. When watching this I thought is this really a Marvel movie or a B movie from made in Japan. I did like the first half of Shang Chi. The second half was just ok. I saw it free because I had a free ticket from my club card. I'm glad I did. Even when I saw the trailer I wasn't expecting anything. I can see why. My opinion is to see this on tv. It is not one of Marvel's best. And those who praise it and say that it is are kidding themselves. Gimme a break."
"To clear out the reviews fight. I believe that the situation is like this:If you love martial arts you will love this film. If you are Chinese you will probably like it, and even more if you live outside China.If you are a huge Marvell fan you will like this movie or at least tolerate it.All the rest will probably be disappointed.It is still a Marvell film, and the quality is good. The story is less good, and at many points loses any common sense even for a ""superheroes"" movies that initially lack any sense. Marvell could do better at least with the story."
"I didn't have high expectations going to a marvel movie but, i can't believe i am saying it, it was really entertaining and a very good movie especially the acting. I hated when the dragons entered the story and i hated it more when they fought. Switching from a nice story and buildup to end up with some stupid unnecessary fight similar to GOT was an extremely bad idea."
"I watched a few Marvel movies for the humor and action, and they were never ""great"" movies to me, so I was expecting to like it but nothing else.In the first few minutes the narrator only speaks Chinese with subtitles, which is a change from the usual immediate switch to English. At the first fighting scene I noticed how cool the music was, It's a bit like dubstep? But it really works with the scenery. Morgan Freeman's small role made me laugh, I didn't expect him there.I was also not expecting to see some things that were slightly mentioned during the movie, I really thought they were gonna keep it mysterious even though it's Marvel.I'm glad the comic relief characters weren't all there all the time, weren't the only ones being funny, and more importantly played a big role in the story. That was very pleasant.Of course the acting was great too, and the sad scenes were believable. I rarely see a main character tearing up. I wish they could cry like a normal human would. A lot of movies suffer from the badass-blank-face protagonist, this wasn't totally the case here.Big pro is the lack of forced romance, kissing and whatever. I hate that stuff. The girl always falls in love with the guy but not here (or it's not shown). Though the parents shouldn't have fallen in love either by my standards
The only bit of blood in the movie was really fake looking, but the other 3D animated made up for itOne thing I'm not happy about is how confusing some action scenes are. No idea what's going on, or where the protagonist is going. It slows down for the important hits, but those are typical Marvel action scenes.I also didn't like that the sister was overshadowed and that she forgave so easily.This is closer to a 10 than a 9 so I gave 10. I'm just so happy I felt something while watching a movie. It's been so long!"
This is not a superhero movie. This is a very entertaining and well acted Chinese film. A MUST SEE ABSOLUTELY WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY...My Grade: A.
One of the most beautiful Marvel films as of yet. On top of that are the visual effects and the fight scenes top level. It will be interessting to see how Shang-Chi will fit in the MCU and whem we will see him next. And btw Wong is a legend. But yeah I should probably go now...ooor...
"The major concepts in this film are genuinely interesting, but they are ruined by several problems that have become a norm for MCU films at this point. The major things being that they commercialize it so much to a point where all of the significantly new and interesting ideas are made boring and bland. What I can say is that the choreography is genuinely excellent. Overall it was fine but it didn't make me feel anything really."
"Well written, funny and well made, this movie make you smile, relax, laugh and hype you up at the same time, watched it in the theaters yesterday and I have to say that it's truly a masterpiece."
Really original and shows a new direction the filming of the MCU can take.
"Glad to see a marvel story that is not a continuation or a reboot. Shang Chi is a lesser known Marvel Character. It does reference that it is in the Marvel universe, but unlike Spider Man: Far from Home Shang Chi stands on it's own has a story.The actors all perform well, everybody plays off each other perfectly. The scenery is so visual, it becomes it's own character. Fight scenes are so intense and inventive. If you think it's another superhero origin story, well it is but at the same time it's not. I hope we see more new marvel films in the future."
"This movie had it all. It had great action and humor (which you would expect from a Marvel movie), but it was also so well-layered with complex characters, compelling themes, and respect for Asian culture. I found myself laughing and crying at this movie. I also loved the guest appearance from an old character long forgotten and some amazing creatures. This movie deserves all the praise it can get."
"Shang-Chi has a promising start with stunning locations with a nice martial-arts-movie feel. The fights were nice. Of course we have some good cracks along the way. Later on, we get into the main story line and that's where it starts to fall off. The jokes start to make you wonder why they are kind of forced into the picture because some of them are very lame. Comedy worked good in Thor: Ragnarok, I really loved them. But here its just bad. That's all.The main problem with the story is that *spoilers alert* Shang Chi and the villagers could have easily made his father understand about the whole soul-eaters thing. That guy seems to have lived more than 1000 years and wouldn't he understand about the whole talking to the mind thing?One last annoying thing is that why the hell they are having two post credits scene as if they were any good. The last one never needed to be in the post credits at all. That's just a normal scene which could have been shown before the credits.Shang-Chi would may be entertaining for those who are new to the whole superhero movies. For others, it may seem very formulaic, doing the same thing with different (weak) stories."
"Disney/Marvel has been applauded for its ethnic diversity in their superhero movies.There is a danger that it could evolve into a cookie cutter approach. Take the easy way out and follow the Black Panther formula.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings does ride that wave.Shaun/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is a slacker in San Francisco parking cars along with best friend Katy (Awkwafina.) Both live an easy lifestyle that involves hard partying. Their other friends have settled down and gone for career goals.For Shaun everything changes when he is attacked one day on the bus. Katy discovers that Shaun has some whip smart martial arts moves.Shaun believes that his father Wenwu a notorious gangster has sent the goons. His sister might also be in danger and flies off to find her.Indeed Wenwu is an infamous and long lived immortal thanks to the Ten Rings. He changed his bad ways when he met and married a woman from a mystical land called Tal-Lo which is in another dimension.Now Wenwu wants to be reunited with his children and go to Tal-Lo to free their mother who he believes is calling out to him. It might be a trap.As in Black Widow, the Marvel Universe is building up to its next phase of superheroes and villains. You sense that there is more to come and again this feels low stakes.Several characters pop in from previous Marvel movies. Liverpool FC is the soccer team of choice for Marvel.There is some balletic martial arts sequences and some inspired Jackie Chan type moves.However the shadow of Black Panther is not far away. The finale is too CGI heavy and it turns into a Godzilla monster on monster type bash with elements of Dune."
"After watching the film I realised the script didn't make that much sense and there were many errors in the writing.The acting also felt very basic and there was hardly any comedy at all, there were a few funny moments from Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley) that were funny but not hilarious. There were many hilarious moments from his character in Iron Man 3 (2013).There has always been a moment in each superhero movie especially a MCU one where's there is a scene in which everyone laughs at, but not in this film.I think myself and most people will laugh at moments in films just because are friends or other auidence members are, when actually we don't find that moment in film funny ourselves.This music wasn't well timed between scenes and should have been more like Hans Zimmer's dramatic style of music, practically in the fight scenes and sentiment moments.Overall it was not that bad, the cinematography was great, and the CGI and Effects were spot on."
"I have to that this movie was great. It has a lot of action in this movie and the choreography in every fight scenes was amazing. Also, the story was interesting and it has a lot of jokes that makes me laugh every time and the CGI and the visual of this movie was great. This movie was very entertaining. This is probably the best MCU solo movie after captain america the winter soldier.Overall, I gave it 8/10 because it was a great action movie. I like itüòÅüëç"
"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema! Well done!"
"Everything about this movie is great I loved it so much the CGI towards the end was lacking but that's not a surprise that they would do that to this Asian led film they did it with black panther as well
The fight scenes are fantastic I loved every one of them. All around damn good movie."
"After the big disappointment of Black Widow, it's safe to say I was anticipating a better outing for Shang Chi and thankfully I lived up.The action is the films biggest plus point. It's where the best scenes are on show, the choreography is brilliant alongside its kung fu/John Wick style fights.The visuals are typical of a Marvel film, solid as always. The film however lost its emotional resonance through its writing. The heart of a film mainly comes from the screenplay and I felt the writing was slightly lazy in parts and that heart faded.It's neither a perfect nor terrible film, it's a solid one that I enjoyed, even if it was hard to truly gravitate towards the characters.Quote - 'Welcome to the Circus' - WongRating - 3/5."
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: The origin story of Shang Chi, his father Xu Wenwu found the Ten Rings of power 1,000 years ago and trough history has been a conqueror and Robber Baron. In 1996 he found Ta Lo a mystical village, but is beaten by it's guardian. Ying Li. They fall in love and have two children, Shang Li and his sister Xiang. Tragedy strikes and Shang Chi is raised to be an assassin, his sister trains in secret. The story is about Xu wanting his children to join with him in a strange quest but things don't go smoothly. Modern style gin battles and those involving mystical weapons abound, well choreographed as are the martial arts sequnces. One great fight aboard a runaway San Francisco bus on those hills. We also have a Cthuluesque devourer of souls with it's flying minions who battle a Chinese Flying Dragon (he's the good guy). There's also a faceless ""winged wombat"" and other mythological beasts. A great adventure. Directed and Co-Written by Destin Daniel Cretton. 8/10."
"""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange."" Wenwu (Tony Leung)This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.Shang-Chi is a Marvel for the whole family and especially the cinephiles curious how The Marvel Cinematic Universe can be so diverse, so entertaining, and so perfect a purveyor of our heroic fantasies."
"That was AMAZING
I thought nothing would take my favorite marvel movie place from avengers infinity war,but I was wrong, because Shang chi took it!"
"... but this is a hit. They somehow succeeded expanding the vast MCU without really forcing it (it goes to show you the richness of American pocket and world culture can go a long way). This is a solid movie, with great action sequences and CGI that delivers. Mind you, SHANG-CHI is not the same without the mesmerizing Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh (when he doesn't fight, the title character is just OK and Awkwafina still isn't funny). Do not wait to watch it on TV because you should experience it at cinema first."
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the first marvel film of phase 4 worth seeing espically when compared to the extremely generic Black Widow movie that came out earlier this year. The pros of the film are definitely it's action sequences and beautiful cinematography. The cons of this movie for me were the humor and the films predictability, but the pros of this film definitely outweigh it's cons."
"A great mix of action, levity, and family drama (who can't relate to that?) not seen since Captain Marvel (a cat hacking a tesseract hairball ... again who can't relate).It is a visual masterpiece with elements any fan of The Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild will swoon over (maybe not something everyone can relate to).If the 10 Rings ""ring"" a bell ... check out Iron Man 3 for a refresher.Also make sure to hang around for mid- and end-credit scenes."
The movie was absolutely AMAZING! I wish I can see it over and over it again! Defiantly will watch it again.
This movie is a great introduction to the character and has a pretty epic ending. Looking forward to seeing more of Shang Chi!
"This movie's biggest strength is the action. It is so well choreographed and so well captured in camera that it is unlike any movie I've seen. That aside, the characters are solid and give depth to the family dynamic at the heart of the story. Where it fumbles is in the third act that feels like it contrasts a lot that it tried to set up in order to have an over the top fantastical element to the show. Overall very enjoyable and is probably the most appealing Marvel movie since Black Panther."
"Let me commence by saying this movie is by far one of the most-fun, action packed Marvel movies ever!Simu Liu is the perfect Marvel protagonist, and Awkwafina delivers the obligatory yet welcomed dose of humor you'd come to expect from a Marvel presentation.But beyond that this movie is rich with mythology, adventure, and incredible martial arts combat that cannot be described with another phrase other than breathtaking, to be the introduction of a new character the story is well-written and you feel as if he had been with us from the start,I give this move the 10 it deserves, In Marvel We Trust."
Really good movie very immersive recommend it to all fans.
"Great Story, great action. This is the movie you definitely wanna watch to bring back that Marvelness."
"It was such an awesome movie, something I would definitely watch again sometime. Now this film is definitely one of my top 5 films, the storytelling was amazing from start to finish. The action scenes in this movie were very Jackie-Chan/Bruce Lee stylish type of martial arts. Loved this movie! 10/10."
"First thing first is the cast in Shang-Chi is excellent. Every performance is great and the chemistry between Shang and Katie is excellent. I am so glad the movie did not create a forced love-interest plot between the two friends. A few of the action sequences are good and better than what we received in Black Widow. The bus fight scene in the first third of the movie in particular is a standout.45 minutes into the movie when Shang-Chi is reunited with his father I was bored beyond belief until the last act of the movie. The film switches gears and continuously dumps exposition on the audience. Everything from here becomes the predictable hero needs to accept his true self story we have seen a million times. Which is a shame because the first act of the movie seemed so fresh from what we typically get with MCU movies. The fight in the last act, while entertaining, are the typical CGI mess found in marvel movies. The one on one between Shang and his father was genuinely emotional, but once you add all the CGI dragons/monsters it becomes a mind-numbing bore.Another thing that bothers me is the character development. Excellent performances aside none of the characters go through any deep growth. The story plays out exactly how you would expect with training montages, green screen vistas and humor ruining any moments of tension. For example, Katie seems to be unnecessarily dragged into everything, learns archery in a few hours, survives a vicious battle and hits the monster right in the neck from who knows how far away. It makes my eyes roll into the back of my head thinking about it. The same thing can be said about Shang's sister. The heart wrenching conflict between her and Shang is quickly resolved and there is no character development for her. It's all nonsense and I need a little more substance with my flashy action.All my gripes aside I was entertained in spurts watching Shang-Chi because of the chemistry between it's stars and some decent action scenes. Which makes it all the more frustrating that is falls into the typical MCU formula after it's first act. Marvel take some freaking risks with your story-telling please!"
"I was pleasantly surprised by a few things:
1. The plot was simple and thus mostly free of unignorable holes.2. Integration of the Chinese elements were quite well done.3. Reasonable development of characters including the bad guy.4. (Mostly) very well orchestrated fight sequences. Quite enjoyable actually. Felt like Jackie Chan at times.5. The movie has a very good tempo. Action and story development do not feel out of the place.6. Not too many of the typical silly wisecracks. Still quite some but not as ridiculous as some movies.There're some stuff one can pick on like the girlfriend and sidekicks felt a bit out of place, some development was a bit too abrupt, plot too simple and typical etc. But none of these prevented the movie from being a quite enjoyable experience."
"Well, here we are... The truth is out: most of the movies by Marvel are way better than most of the movies by anyone else. There's a story, beautiful visuals, love and drama, some comedy - a package well worth big screen experience! Go and see it if you are a fan of action and/or fantasy magical movies! It does it all."
"The Action scenes were on par with the crouching tiger hidden dragon and other awesome awesome Kung Fu movies that that came before. There was bruce Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan is Jackie Chan elements to elements to the fight scenes.The comedy was not over the top or too much or forced into areas to break up the heavy drama. Like the Cape in Dr. Strange whipping away the tear.Hoodnmobie, better than I expected."
"Went to cinemas after year and half .Totaly worth it,macau fight scene stole the movie."
"This film us well written and directed. All the action sequences are well choreographed. This is an origin story but it will not give you marvel movie vibe(in a positive way) until and unless you will see the post credit scenes. Yes, there are 2 credit scenes. Simu liu and Tony was the highlight of the movie, Awkwafina has also performed well. Her chemistry with Simu was extraordinary and her comic timing was also perfect."
"Shang chi is One of the Best Solo movie till now in Marvel. If you are waiting to come it on OTT platform , you are gonna regret for not watching it in Theaters,(unless due to Covid-19) .Visuals are so much OP in this movie. BGM of this movie will give you the vibes of Kung fu panda(Chinese Instruments), with some Dj snake Officials.Martial Arts And Other Fighting Sequences are also Very Amazing in this movie.For those who are Searching a good movie after 2 years of covid, this movie is that you should watch i.t
Beware of Spoilers and you will Enjoy the movie."
"Shang Chi movie Review
No spoilers
Oh wow! I really loved this film! It really went above and beyond my expectations. To tell you the truth I had no idea of how it would play out. As a matter of fact I am pretty good at predicting this but this movie really had me guessing. I highly recommend to watch this film. Of course it's a Disney Film so it gave vibes similar to Mulan and of course it's an Oriental film so it gave vibes of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. And of course it's a Marvel Comics film but this isn't your regular Marvel movie. I highly recommend you to watch it if you haven't already. You are going to love it. Trust me. This is worth every penny."
"Honestly one of the best Marvel movies made to date, up-to-par and could even surpass Black Panther. The acting (especially Tony Leung, the dad) was incredible, along with the visuals, soundtrack, storyline, and writing. Loved how they actually spoke Chinese in the authentic scenes vs making them speak english the whole time with an accent. True to the Asian culture, and definitely did us proud!"
"I really liked this movie and I'm a full-on marvel fan, I usually like Wanda over all the other characters, but this film makes me like Shang-Chi now too. And all this time I would have never thought I would like another character. Marvel, you have outdone yourselves for sure!"
"Perfect casting, great flow throughout, solid story and character development. Great movie to take the family to watch. Provides many topics for conversation-change for the better, start doesn't dictate the end, see the good in all, cherish our loved ones and many others. For me the mark of a really good movie is the can't wait for the next movie and I can't wait for chapter two!!"
"Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a great Marvel Studios film. The story was fun and engaging, and was surprisingly emotional, with Shang Chi's relationship with his father and sister. The father's death was surprisingly impactful, and which the movie did well. One issue with the story was that the film would take a pause with the plot for flashbacks and exposition. They do make the film boring and slow at times, but there's not many. Plus, the flashbacks can be helpful
The visuals and action scenes in this film are, in my opinion, some of the best action scenes in the MCU. The film takes advantage of the martial arts action to deliver epic fight scenes. The visuals were also stellar. The CGI was top notch, and the backgrounds were some of the best from Marvel.The Characters were all fun to watch, and throughout the movie, you feel engaged in these characters. Shang Chi and Katy's chemistry is great. The villain was a great antagonist in this film. Some characters were bland and forgettable, but the good ones shine the most throughout the film.Overall, it's a great MCU film with a compelling story, great fights and visuals, and engaging characters. IT can be a bit slow at times, but the film is a must watch. MY favorite MCU film since Far From Home."
"I never write reviews but let me tell you I enjoyed this movie with every inch of my heart and I speak for the rest of the people in the theate as well, it was definitely a big win for Chinese-Americans I just simply enjoyed how it portrayed both the English and Chinese language! I recommend this movie to anyone or any family out there looking for a good laugh and a beautiful cinematic piece. SHANG-CHI:)"
Watch this in theaters! It was a great storyline with well developed characters. The entire cast was fantastic and it had moments of humor and seriousness seamlessly blended in! Loved seeing an Asian superhero who rocked it!! He was brilliant.
"Honestly, I'm very happy to write a good review for a change!! It's been almost 2 years since anything decent came out ( tenet was amazing too) but pretty much everything was garbage! I thought that bar of quality has fallen so low and no way back up!But HOLY COW!!!!! Everything about this movie is great! It's funny, it's beautiful, has great writing, great CG, amazing fighting scenes, and even magical creatures!Neutral non political proper comic book story!Well done Mr. Kevin & Louis!Please keep up! And thank you üôè"
"Best action and sci fi movie ever. Pliz go and watch this movie, it's one of the finest movie of marvel, marvel do good job."
"Excellent cast. Story was fine. Jokes were funny. Action was well filmed and you could see what was actually happening (snake eyes, take note). Much better than black widow."
"The VFX and CGI of this movies were both great and the best in a debut movie in my point of view, the action scenes were so good even my father who didn't wanted to see the movie loved it.And the movie is purely family friendly.Overall I really liked the movie, it made a lot of new fans of the MCU community."
Marvel is back to its root with this one it is not perfect film but hell of lot more entertaing than black widow and far from home.And their is big surprise in the film which i wont spoil but yeah watch it in the theaters or home but watch it nontheless because its great film. With heart and soul with it.
Action packed movie with comedy... and the KAMEHAMEHA.....
"Growing up as a kid on kung fu movies, Went into shang-chi with opened mind.Well, It blown me away, The cast were outstanding, the visual effects, Cinematography, vibrant colours, the fight scenes are fantastic and Enjoyed the music as well.Found myself laughing at time, exited and emotional.MCU have added more characters, diversity and new possibilities.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings
was spectacular movie to watch."
"I'm not someone who is a fan of action movies. I'm really not. But even here, there's no denying the action sequences are brilliantly executed and have a lot more of a hit than most of the marvel movies out there.Although Simu Liu falters a little bit as a leading man, he has a truly impressive cast to support him. Awkwafina is brilliantly funny and quippy as she always is. And Tony Leung, the complex antagonist and the hero's father, has the most depth in this film.The visual effects are beyond beautiful. They reminded me of Ferngully, and the nature I observed as a child. Good stuff!There are some surprising cameos that are both hilarious and wholesome.It was so good to see it in Imax after such a long cinema hiatus. Definitely check this one out!"
"As an Asian American, it is so excited to see a new series on Asian characters. Thank you Marvel!This could be the best visual representation of Kongfu among Hollywood movies, especially the part between Shang-Chi's dad and mom.The music is amazing too.I wish the understanding to Asian culture could have been deeper tho.For example, when the history was introduced by Shangchi's Aunty, it was wooden sculpture used to visually present it. But in ancient China, when good things are documented, they were carved on stone monument and when bad things happened, they were documented in books.The essence about Yin-Yang, why Shang Chi's mom could easily handle his father's 10 rings Kong fu, was not presented clearly at all. It's a lot more than 'knowing who you are'.When I checked out writers, I think understood why. I guess at least there could have been a consultant who understood those part to help drafting the story details, because those are real gems from Asian culture and it was deep wisdom.But, these did not block me from enjoying the movie. It was a blast watching it, even for someone who grew up watching KongFu movie."
"Well it's 9.5
This movie is deserved to be watched at theaters
Action-11/10
Emotion-9/10
Story-10/10
The only flaw in this movie is it is little bit fast paced."
"Very impressed with the entire movie. Great visual effects, action scenes were on point. Well written story. Definitely a must see."
It was amazing from the visuals to the depth of the store to the inside jokes that only true marvel fans will notice. This just another masterpiece made by marvel studios.
Was such a great movie and then the climatic fight was amazing (side note if Disney got the rights to do a dragon ball z live action movie it would be great if they use the same director of this movie)
"I watched best movie by marvel its full cocktail with action , drama , emotion , comedy special thanks for pina and sir ben. K tony sir and the actor who ply Shangchi whol cast are superb in their role they did great work and last epic dragon vs dragon fight was Great unfortunately there are no open theater in my state so I watched it in my lptop but great experience."
"This movie was spectacular. From the visuals, action sequences, and soundtrack. Everything was amazing. Literally had full body chills watching this movie!"
"I have nothing negative to say about this movie it's perfect, highly entertaining and fun, action packed, emotional, great story telling and comedic as well! Awesome post credit scenes as well! Can't wait for the second one!!"
"I once said after watching Black Panther, that it would be cool if there was an all Asian cast similar to it. There were some all Asian cast movies like Crazy Rich Asian (2018), but that is a romcom, and Mulan (2020), but that was bad. In comes Shang Chi which is the first Asian lead Superhero movie ever. The premise is ""Martial-arts master Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) confronts the past he thought he left behind when he's drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization"". So does Shang Chi succeed in giving us a good all Asian cast big blockbuster or is it just another failed attempt?Firstly, the action sequences and choreography are some of the best from Marvel since Captain America and the Winter Soldier (2014). Martial arts are the focus of the action scenes in Shang Chi and they are beautifully choreographed. We get the classic wire-fu/floating style of Crouching Tiger but we also get some Jackie Chan style with the utilization of the environment for the action. Each action scene is memorable and stunning to watch. Additionally, the action scenes avoid using lots of cuts and shaky cam which I was so grateful for. It is also clear that the actors themselves rehearsed the choreography making the fights feel more believable and gratifying. It does become a more typical MCU action sequence by the third act but even that is still pretty enjoyable even if it isn't as good as the first two acts.The cinematography by Bill Pope (Matrix trilogy, Spiderman 2 and 3, Scott Pilgrim) is also excellent in Shang Chi. Skyscrapers and forests in Marvel movies have never looked as good as it has in Shang Chi. Bill pope and director Destin use the lighting and colours very effectively and allow for some genuinely beautiful shots. The music score by Joel P. West is also pretty good. Joel utilizes more electronic sounds and pop/rap songs for the scenes in the city but uses more traditional Asian instruments for the mystical areas. Joel's score captures the scene and the pop/rap songs themselves are also quite good albeit not as memorable as the Weeknd or Lamar from Black Panther. I also love the story and exploration of ""family"" with Shang Chi whilst not using Asian stereotypes. It also doesn't overuse humour like in Marvel's previous outing, Black Widow (2021), where they use jokes every couple of minutes and ruin a serious scene. Shang Chi thankfully avoids doing this, thus allowing the emotion of a scene to linger longer. There are still jokes though but they are genuinely quite funny.Furthermore, Simu Liu is charismatic, charming and cool as the titular character Shang Chi. I think Marvel succeeds again in the casting department as Simu Liu delivers on making me believe that this guy is a top tier martial artist. I also think Simu gives a good performance during the more emotional moments as well. His chemistry with Awkwafina who plays Shang Chi's friend Katy is great too. The banter between Shang Chi and Katy is some of the funniest scenes and makes me believe that those two were friends for years. However, Tony Leung who plays the main villain Wenwu (the real Mandarin) is the one that steals the show. Tony Leung is just phenomenal as he can convey the exact emotions of his character just through body language alone, it is just masterful acting. My biggest worry with MCU origin movies is that the villains are lacklustre but Shang Chi does not fall into this. Wenwu is very sympathetic but also extremely fearsome. He is also the father of Shang Chi which makes the conflict between them feel more meaningful and tragic. Wenwu is not a straight-up evil person as he does still have good in him and I like that.Unfortunately, Shang Chi suffers from having the 3 villain problem. Razorfist played by Florian is Wenwu's henchman and he doesn't get any backstory. I don't mind him that much though as he is mostly there to chase Shang Chi like a 007 henchman. There is also a scene where he does seem visibly worried about Wenwu's health which gives him some character depth. On the other hand, the 3rd villain Death Dealer who is a mysterious assassin of Wenwu is a massive disappointment. He looks very cool and visibly distinct from other ten ring members and is relevant to Shang Chi's past but amounts to absolutely nothing.Moreover, there is also a 3rd hero to Shang Chi and Katy with Shang Chi's sister Xialing played by Meng'er Zhang. She doesn't get enough interactions with Shang Chi, Katy or her father Wenwu and that feels like a waste. It's a shame as her interactions with both Shang Chi and Katy are enjoyable and she also doesn't interact with her dad Wenwu which is just a missed opportunity for her character. The movie also has a pacing issue as it slows down significantly in the second act. It just featured a lot of talking, exposition and flashbacks which I felt could have been cut down by a couple of minutes.Overall, Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the all Asian cast movie I have been waiting for. It delivers on the action, story and characters while being an exciting new addition to the MCU. I can't wait to see more of Shang Chi and finally get to see an Asian in the Avengers team."
"Usual Marvel origin movie would be :
Predictable story (check)
Sarcastic tone with awesome punchlines(check)
Ending with hyping for next movie(check)
It checked all necessary boxes on top of that the martial arts and awesome fast paced plot and CGI packed with Stunning Visuals and awesome Score and that post credits was like cherry on top!It's a coolest Marvel's superhero origin Yet!"
"At first glance, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is emotional, engaging and action packed. The truth is that there's so much more behind the surface. It is a story of self discovery, full of great character arcs, glorious fight scenes and dynamic choreography. Simu Liu really shines as the main character: he brings so much charm to the role that it's easy to grow fond of him. The director, Destin Daniel Cretton, manages to create a new mythology, both inspired by the comics and the Chinese tradition. The visual effects are great, even outstanding during certain moments, as well as the concept design of all the mythical creatures. Finally, the music really meshes amazingly with the scenes, especially when there's more action and emotion. A new modern superhero has arrived and he's ready to deliver some punches. This movie really pulls off a great origin story that proves, once again, the endless possibilities the Marvel Cinematic Universe has yet to offer."
"I enjoyed seeing the Asian culture mixed with American culture especially that this is a marvel movie. Very enjoyable, and as mentioned different and creative."
"Great movie and fight scenes, recommend to everyone."
"Watched Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings - despite the movie title sounding like one of those 1940s black and white ""Detective Dee and the...."" types, the film is visually stunning: stunning scenery, magical creatures, gorgeous costumes, no-holds-barred fight scenes that are as much dancing as fighting, you name it.I do have issues, however. The first is that I think Marvel was so worried about offending China or the Chinese people that the film comes across as very safe. Far too much on its dignity. If the film were a job interview, it would have been for the position of senior Vice President at the Chinese equivalent of the Louvre. Even Akwafina, who I usually count on to deliver a raunchy belly-laugh of a good time, was very composed and restrained.I'm also wondering why they bothered including Shang-Chi's sister. She doesn't really *do* anything except be moody and resentful for the majority of the film. Even in the after-scene, she's not there. As far as I can tell, the entire point of her inclusion in the film is to get Shang-Chi to Macau (bonus points for it not being the overused Hong Kong or Singapore!).Dignity or not, there was plenty of opportunity where they could have upped the humour quotient. The Chinese people are dignified - famous for it - but they also have a ribald and sophisticated sense of humour. I would have *loved* to see sly digs at Western culture, more commentary on differences between East and West (you can't tell me a guy spends his life in an isolated Chinese compound or in the States then just seamlessly segues to Macau's urban lifestyle!), that kind of thing - more than the stereotypical ""When are you getting married? When are you going to get a real job?"" conversation. Basically, they could have really *done* something with this movie, over and above a superhero story.One thing I *really* want to see is a guide to the creatures we see in the film. They are so beautifully rendered! The Fu Dogs, for example - I was mesmerized watching the tiny little movements - ear flicks, muscle twitches as if reacting to a bug bite, the movement of the fur and mane: magnificent! But there were so many others I have no clue what they were other than they looked like Chinese mythological creatures and I would love to know more about them."
"After a disappointing Marvel entry with Black Widow, Shang-Chi is the return to form movie Marvel needed to bounce back off on. With solid performances, great setpieces, fun action sequences, and some emotional depth and humour to it, it's the type of film you need to see on the big screen and just go along with the journey and fantastical elements. It's also paced well and intriguing for the runtime it has.The direction is solid and the characters get a good amount of screen time each to develop and have well placed flashback sequences. The martial arts fights are pretty well done and the CGI creatures look interesting with their designs and have good special effects. Overall, it's very well done and I didn't think Marvel could keep going, but they proved they can still make great stuff when they care about it.8/10."
"This was a lot of fun to watch. The cast was great. They made their characters believable, funny, and told a great story. It held its own very well. The action scenes blend with everything they did. It's nice to watch something that takes you away, and you get lost in it. Great movie can't wait to watch it again."
"Some reviews act like it's new coming of martial arts cinema or something, but no. It's just harry potter who does kung fu. Very generic and predictable."
"Let me start by saying damnnn, Marvel made an absoluut banger of a movie. It has one of the most developed antagonist in a marvel film and the CGI is just stunning to watch, let alone a very good story and all the great fight scenes.From beginning to end I had one big smile. If this is the first film of phase 4 then I can only expect bigger things to happen.Of course if you are a marvel fan go watch it!! But also if you are not this is in my opinion the best marvel film made and definitely worth your money.Phase 4 is destined for greatness."
"An extremely boring film with absolutely predictable plot that is not worth paying attention to.Medium acting, but Katy... Total cringe in 90% of the movie.Fighting scenes is good."
I've seen this twice and going for a third time this weekend. The fight scenes are *chefs kiss*. You're living under a rock if you haven't seen this film yet!
"Marvel productions are anything but boring. The film had good representation of the Chinese culture and good visuals, but the plot was very indirect, full of gaps and unexplained things, shallow characterising. It's a certain thing until it turns out to be something else the next second. Quick shifts in the plot. A bit of forced comedy too, and the lack of interesting hooks. This is a Marvel disappointment."
"This film had some very funny and unique moments in it, but overall I think the story was quite weak and there weren't any moments where I was fully into the movie. I think sequels could have good potential but I left the cinema without much excitement. Don't get me wrong it's a good movie but there are so many marvel films that top this one in storyline and character developed ect. I think 6 is a reasonable score I would give 6.5 if this were an option but 7 is a bit generous. Don't believe these 10/10 reviews. 10 is reserved for cinematic masterpieces like the dark night or infinity war."
"POSITIVE
-great Casting (SImu Liu, Tony Lueng). Especially Tony Lueng because he look badass and has
great acting skill.-You've already heard people praising the film's action choreography, and it's well-deserved. It
doesn't has many cut scenes like many MCU fighting scenes.-This film felt completely unique from what we've seen from the MCU already.-Props to the beautiful cinematography and soundtrack as well, they were great!-The first two act was incredible and amazing showing the life of Shang-Chi, how Wenwu meet
his wife etc. This type of act is something MCU usually doesn't have.-This film open up MCU to new world with myth creature, many evil organization, and the
mystery of the Ten Rings.NEGATIVE
-The casting was STELLAR. Aside from the one person I didn't care for (*Razor Fist, cough
cough*) everybody played their roles to perfection.-The jokes may not be funny to some people. But It's funny to me.-The only issue I had with Shang-Chi was the third act. Not that it was bad, but it felt
detracting from what the first 2/3rds of the movie established. It become every MCU logic
part(CGI BATTLE). It took away from the great hand-to-hand action stunt work, but it's to be
expected from a film of this genre.The exposition can be a bit heavy but understandably needed to introduce a brand newcharacter into this universe.IMO
Great way to introduce new hero. Great Martial art fight scenes. Great characters. Looking forward to Shang-Chi. Also Wenwu.Not a Top Tier Film in Movie Industry but A Top Tier Film in MCU STANDALONE movies."
"Nonsense dumb time wasted.Lots of dumb jokes
Nothing new
Weak story
Making fun of male characters is not nice and we don't want to see that."
"This movie was amazing. Goes straight to my favourite movie list. It had an amazing story line, great acting, mesmerising cinematography and good humour. It had some spectacular fight scenes. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone!!! It's a must see."
"Loved the all-asian cast, but i understand many people aren't going to like that because of their own insecurities, but aside from that the cgi, storyline, and characters all brought an interesting rendition for each of their own and the post credit scene was also a really cool connector into how Shang-Chi may fit in with his new avenger buddies."
"This movie has great kung fu, wonderful story, good acting besides the usual special effects. I enjoyed this movie more than ""black widow"". The action would be home in any of the classic kung fu movies.I hope the shang chi and the ten rings returns soon."

"I'm a huge Marvel fan and they continue to disappoint in this phase. It's all about shallow virtue signaling and not about character anymore. Why on earth did they decide to go in this direction after Endgame? This movie had it's moments but gets lost and it's on woke lack of depth. I pray this isn't the end of the marvel cinematic universe because we all enjoyed it so much. If it is the end, it was a great 11 year run. Don't waste your time with this nonsense."
"Shang chi is really a fantastic film,reached the expectations very well. Absolutely there is no DOUT,this movie would be one of the Best ACTION film in MCU. This movie has so much of action that we never experienced in MCU quite often. It is purely entertaining for the starting to the end. I would say everyone should watch this movie in theaters and experience the action and the music(bgm) was so awesomeüòç.THIS MOVIE üé• IS GOING TO BRING NEW ERA OF SUPERHERO."
Aesthetically beautiful and such likable characters.Amazing work by Simu Liu and Awkwafina. Also a special shoutout to Ben Kingsley whose Trevor Slattery made me laugh so hard everytime he was on the screen.Can't wait to see what's coming in the MCU to these amazing characters.
This new marvel movie is just bad. The main actor can't act and it's more about the side characters then him.
From the beginning I was fooled believing it would be a cliche origin story but completely shattered my expectations by the end. This movie is extremely fun and will leave you stunned by the end. The choreography of the fighting was flawless and give no disappointing action scenes. There aren't any groundbreaking performances especially by the lead. This doesn't take anything away from the film though and I am confident he will improve and become more comfortable. Don't leave during the credits!Absolutely needs to be seen in theaters! Great movie.
"Ok, so I really liked it. In particular I really liked the characters. I loved the hero's journey that Shang Chi went on. I loved his relationship with Katy and his sister. They were all likable, and badass in their own way. And you could empathize with them. I thought this was a very strong villain. Not just physically, but very compelling. A lot of MCU villains can come across as very one note. But he was complex and layered. So that was great to see. And of course they were all strongly acted as well. Akwafina is maybe the least strongest out of the main cast (Check out The Farewell if you really want to see her shine) but like, she is still is good in this.I loved the fight choreography in this. Probably some of the best fight scenes you get in the MCU. And I loved the visuals used in those scenes as well. Some shots were truly stunning to watch.One downside I had though is that I wanted to know more about how the magic works. Like the final battle between Shang Chi and his father he has suddenly mastered his mother's magic/fighting. And I know the movie kind of pokes fun of this at the end by having Shang Chi tell his friends that he had 1 day of training. But seriously, how did that happen? Is it just because he's his mother's son? Is it because he was specifically in that place? I just needed a little more backstory/explanation. Also, the Wong/Abomination fight (which was totally spoiled in the trailers) didnt really do anything and just added more questions. I guess they needed a way to set up Wong for the mid credits scene though. And that mid credits scene in general just raised more questions for me. Like why is Bruce back to being in his human form? It clearly takes place after the events of Endgame (judging by his arm sling) so why is he not in his Professor Hulk form?I thought the comedy was good for the most part. I think it worked well with the beginning and ending of the film. But didnt always land during the more meatier parts of the film. Theres maybe a few other elements I could nitpick but for the most part I really liked this film. Im not sure where I would rank it yet. I think probably a top 10-er."
"Marvel does a lot right, and a good fight scene is one of them. But this movie had battles and characters that are only available in the context of this new world and this story. Despite a ""classic"" and somewhat cliche story it brought me a lot of joy. Classics are classic for a reason right? Cliches are powerful in the right light. Also the post credit scenes! Yes! Marvelllllll you did it again."
"Mannnn... this movie is good.Let me... just say.. first of all.. OMG THE FIGHTS! THE ACTION! OH.. MY.. GOD. Marvel did it again after having a slight setback with the just okay black widow movie. This movie has the best fight scenes I've seen since the raid films. The fights are so well choreographed but also fast paced and filmed to perfection. The bus fight is incredible!!!!! The fight in the beginning between the mandarin and the mother.. wow wow wow...
OKAY Back to reality. This movie does have flaws. First of all the pacing in like the 3/4rd of the film is a tat slow. The score honestly is weak. Might be my theater but there were moments where the score had to make me feel something and (credits to the movie itself that it let me ) i had to do that all by myself.The plot sometimes leans to a pretty basic plot, but because of the great screenplay it works.Cinematography was amazing. The acting was good. And the special effects were very good. One thing that I have to admit. Game of thrones kind of spoiled us with the design of .. a particular mythical creature so... that won't look as great as it could've been but still very good.But man the fights were incredible.. the camera work was so good. Fluent movements but fast and I could see EVERYTHING. After snake eyes I thought I would never see a good martial arts movie again considering how average that was.Thank you, shang chi. You made my night.9 out of 10. Welcome back marvel."
"Despite them not promoting this a lot it was a game changer, different kind of genre and pace! They mixed and match well.The CGI out of this world, and the acting chemistry between all actors, thanks for blessing us!Best movie of this year, easily 10/10. You would be surprised with some newcomers to marvel!Be prepared to have your mind blown!!!"
"This movie was fantastic! It did a great job of standing on its own while including little easter eggs from the rest of the MCU throughout the film. Simu and Awk killed their roles, and I can't wait to see more from them as these characters. The story was so compelling, and the theme of the movie was so unique and refreshing in an industry that usually white-washes Asian-lead films. I cannot stress enough how well they also executed the use of female roles to empower women to accomplish their goals. Katy and Xialing were along with Shang through the whole ride and played just as important of roles as he did. Lastly, the inclusion of Shang and Katy into the MCU longterm is such a good move on the part of Marvel. I am so ready for what's to come after that end credit scene, including the last one about The Ten Rings ;). 9/10 from me, Marvel is still out here killing the game. People who hate on this movie don't understand good cinema."
"Marvel has not done much good lately. 2 horrible TV shows, and 1 bad TV show. Not a single good movie since Captain Marvel, and nothing seemingly good coming over the horizon.To be honest I have started to give up. Marvel have produced magnificent movies and great entertainment for many years, but lately it is like that magic has come off and they seem much more run of the mill basic with that, by now, boring Marvel feel. Marvel has tried to introduce more political correctness, more feminism, and more nonsense diversity, and it has all failed.This movie however is not a failure.Why?This movie is simple, it is to the point, it follows tropes, cliches, and it is a classic heroes journey - which is exactly why it works!Marvel took a classical story we all heard, read and seen before but they switched a few things around, kept some of that Marvel feel, and made it play out mainly in China and almost only with Chinese actors. And it works!Imagine that? Sure you can find some political nonsense if you look hard enough, but who cares when you have great fight scenes, lovely sceneries, a great (but basic) story and brilliant well written characters.We even get a villain that you understand, sympathise with and even feel a sting of ""ah, too bad"" about him.This is how you make an action movie! Great stuff Marvel!The points I deduct is due to the movie not being that amazing. They pull the heroes journey of sure, but we have also seen it done better. Sound is great, but not amazing, directing is great, but not amazing, etc. Etc. Everything about this movie is high class, greatly done, and well performed, but it is not on top, it is not amazing nor perfect.I also have a few objections about the background story and the ending, but I am keeping this spoiler free so...8/10. This is a great movie and highly entertaining, and definitely worth the ticket price. Go see and get your faith in Marvel restored."
"Movie like this is way better to watch on streaming than on cinema, i'm actually regretting going to watch this. While Suicide Squad was at least something new for DC, Shang-Chi was absolutely nothing new for Marvel."
Its not good at all..he learns the rings technique and wins basically mothra shows up kills dad village saved worst cameos ever worst ever film bar suicide squad 2.....trust me i saved you alot of money and time!!
"Another lame attempt from Disney own Marvel to cash in on an old school Marvel character. Completely ruined another character that has a 40+ year history. Story base on little to no facts and showed little abilities of the character. If you cant get the story right just come up was a totally new character.I'm so glad i got out of comics back in 2003 Disney is doing nothing but ruining the history of everything they touch. I should have stayed at home and watched the Netflix movie ""Kate"" and saved my money. Even ""Jolt"" had more action.Spoiler Jolt and Kate were better movies."
"As I sat in the theater, my butt sore, I said to myself, ""How much longer? Can I fast forward?""1. This film tries too hard to please Chinese authorities and make Marvel money in China. All bow down to the mighty dollar!2. The pacing is GLACIAL. Shang-Chi is Mandarin for 60 minutes too long. My wife disagrees. She actually speaks Mandarin and says it means 30 minutes too long.3. The lead character has all sorts of mental anguish over one person he killed, but in the film before this point, we have seen him kill several people.4. Half this film makes no sense. For instance, the daughter of the bad guy escapes then starts an underground fight empire? Why? So there can be a cameo from another Marvel character and a big skyscraper fight scene that feels like it has zero consequences. And it does, because once the fight is over, they just give themselves up to the bad guy, their father. What?5. Why the hell does nobody have any guns?6. Isn't the Marvel universe a bit full of evil organizations that nobody has heard of? Hydra is gone. Now daddy and his rings are here.7. They clipped Awkwafina's wings to make her palatable to the brainless Chinese market. She's a dirty, nasty comedian, and they make her an idiot.8. White people are in the film only to play comic relief. There's Mr. Armsword, a buffoon. Then there's The Mandarin, an idiot. Why? Oh yeah, gotta please the Commie government.Ben Kingsley is the ONLY bright spot in this turd film. He's genuinely funny as the Mandarin."
"This is a beautiful movie, and it is entertaining. However the plot could not be more basic and the characters development more limited to what they could fit in between action scenes. All of this alongside some quite weird choices as to make Shaun's friend an essential character to the development of the story for future movies when she has no reason to be part of it at all, other than for being a liability... so all in all, I had a good time at the movie, but that's it. I reserve my good notes for movies that really deserve them."
"Marvel has stopped trying and no longer wants to risk it. Why should they, when movies like this get all the praise.In the beginning, Shaun was actually likeable, but as the movie progresses, he just kinda does stuff and his motivations are almost inexistent. The rest of the characters are bland and uninteresting.The plot is all over the place and boring, filled with explanation after flashback after explanation, which makes it too long.The fight scenes start off good, but then they just become huge and filled with cgi, and that just makes it boring for me.In conclusion, this is a weekend movie to see with your family when it comes on tv, the kids will love it but the adults will forget it after 3 days. Just a generic tasteless movie."
"The story is like trying to say a lot but all over the place. It doesn't have any genuine nature to Eastern films, it clearly shows American crowd appeasing film made just to say to Asians, ""Look we did film for you by casting all Asians and few others and an amazing story"". It fails in many aspects be it from story, or acting or visuals, but they are always expert in marketing the mediocre or sometimes even worse film as good, great so on and make money.This movie didn't have heart in right place at first instance. You don't even connect to Shang Chi's character neither anyone in the other roles. It's just feels so cookedup without genuine touch of Chinese or HK films. There is no strong theme or purpose of who is doing and what for. It all feels like we are doing this to make a character for Marvel.The Marvels' usual formulaic movies are ripping off stories and many comics too, and it looks they only could touch upon few aspects of visuals in here but overall its an average or below average film. Since it's close to post pandemic times, so everyone are eager to watch, so it helped movie to shine through.This PCness of Hollywood and American culture should shove their mindset in their A@#$ and let people do make their genuine films and accept the way it is rather then poking their nose in each films to give an mixed bag approach. They ruined Mulan doing this screwed up mindset of film making approach. I'm sure they will cover it up in Eternals, but still all these super hero movies now are so junk it seems."
Was a great time. A lot of action. Very good story. It's a different feel than other Marvel movies.
"This is one of my favourite Marvel origin films.The storyline, visuals, the cast, fight and stunt scenes were amazing. In fact I'd say it was beautiful and respectfully made.Simu is perfect as Shang-Chi, sorry I doubted his casting as kept thinking of Jung from Kim's Convenience (good show)."
Just watched the movie and i am speechless. The fight scenes were absolutely perfect and made my jaw drop. The character's were perfect and the little bit of comedy that was added made the movie even more amazing. If i could watch this movie again for the first time i would because the experience was out of this world.
"Saw this on opening night and it was soooo worth it! Amazing fighting sequences and choreography, amazing cinematography, amazing acting (especially by legendary Tony Leung), and the storyline is interesting and moving. Lots of LOL moments and surprise guest appearances. I rarely pay the $15 to see a movie in the theater but this one I will do again!"
"The action, martial arts, and cinematography is top-notch. I find myself nodding in awe and saying ""wow"" in many scenes. I'm left craving for more action. I love the idea of power being combined with skill. The martial arts element really adds creativity and a whole new world of moves and skills open up. It's not a bunch of powerful people throwing out nonstop blasts or a strong thing throwing brute punching left and right.The world is beautiful. The musical guides you. The tone filled with art and symbolism. Beautiful all around. And shoutout to Ronny Chieng! Seeing him make an appearance was pretty funny.With some of the weaker elements I will have to point to the pacing. There were a few moments that felt dragged out or unnecessary. Some screen time was given to certain characters that didn't need it and they should focus a little more time on certain relationships.Overall I enjoyed the movie and lot and was left craving for more."
"As a Marvel Fanboy, this movie forms the plot for a big villian entering into MCU from multiverse. The rings are a beacon, and ita calling someone, maybe Galactus or Doormamu or something big and powerful, more power than Thanos!Watch it in theatres! All the actors are amazing and I loved Awkwafina's role.Must, must, must watch !!!!"
"I enjoyed watching it, but the movie is overrated, it's ok, but I'm clueless as to why the critics gave this such high ratings. To much hype."
What a outstanding movie.there was full of entertainment. I enjoyed alot.
So far one of the best movies that I have seen in recent years. One of my 10 tops.
"After an 18 months absence from the cinema, this was a great first film to watch. Visually it's amazing, great fight scenes, loved the actors and actresses and so funny. And the icing on the cake was Ben Kingsley, not sure why he was there but it really worked."
First review ever. All I have to say is you need to see the phenomenon for yourself.
""" If you aim at nothing, you get nothing ""Shang chi gets most of the part right with crazy action choreography which is undoubtedly the major attraction. First act is racy and has crazy action episodes and later, the recurring flashbacks served the story purpose but at the same time, slightly hindered the flow. Not a big issue though as the action part kicks in and makes up for it. Third act ten rings action visuals are pretty damn good and the water formation is breathtaking which reminded me of Raya.New guy "" Simu Liu "" owned the Shang chi role, as his efforts are clearly visible on the screen. Especially during action episodes , he nailed it with his quick reflexes, even Meng'er Zhang as Chi's sister did put up an impressive act and Awkwafina provided a bit of humor with her quirky attitude . Fala Chen is so beautiful, i fell head over heels for her smile. The man, Tony Leung stood tall and delivered with panache, his presence worked big time. Always love to see Michelle Yeoh on the screen , she got that aura which pulls me in. Trevor and Morris stole the show, loved their bonding :)Over all , with couple of surprises , good performances , amazing score , striking visuals and top notch action pieces makes this one an enjoyable ride throughout. Had a good time at the cinemas. Simu Liu is a fine addition to the MCU. Easily deserves solid 7-7.5 rating !!First post credit scene is whistle worthy moment , JUST WOW!!!"
"Top 5 Marvel movies for me. I loved the action and fight scenes, music, cinematography and set colors, and the humor. I genuinely liked the main characters and rooted for them. It's 100% worth seeing! I want to see it a second time."
"Smart, Funny, and Beautiful, hits the right strings with a good pace. Awkwafina's Katy really grows in the film and grows on you. Solid performances from legendary Yeoh and Leung. Although most of the movie it's easy to forget it's in the MCU, Fun callback to a previously thrown away character and also a nice bridge to known elements of the MCU. Plenty of new fare for figuring out the next phase of the MCU (and multiverse?). Two end credit scenes so stick around."
"Visually outstanding, the choreography of the fight scenes was one of the greatest I ever watched in recent movies. Michelle Yeoh own every single scene that she was on it and Awkwafina was funny as ever. And the story? Great, some plot twists and with great clues to follow the next phase of the MCU!"
"LikesGreat Pacing:
Shang Chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series. With all the information, there might be worry of the pace being off, but surprisingly it is done super well. Never really dragging, but not moving a blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi's combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters. The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.Character Development:
The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang's life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.The Surprise Cameo:
Can't say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character's return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.The Cultural Influence:
Like Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history. I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale, and though again a little predictable and flaunting, really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others.The CGI
Finally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do. Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves. Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed, the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements, and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects.The Acting:
A great part played by all members on this film, extras included, Shang Chi's cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well. Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic, and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results. He holds much of the prodigal martial artist, disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style. However, he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum. Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays, but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past. I loved how well she was used in this film, and how great she complemented Simu in this role. Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character, once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist, and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi. So many other great actors and actresses in this film, but due to time restrictions I have to move on, but trust me they did well in their performances.The Comedy:
Awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh, and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly. However, Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice. Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs, with well-timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy. There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place, but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up. And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie. It's all done so well and I was very happy with the results.The Action:
My bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered very well on this film's action expos√©. The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture, and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema. It's exciting, it's dynamic, and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect. Used well in the story, there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking. Even more so, the strategies behind them and what is required to win, accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era, so well done on that too.A Bit More Adult:
The movie is definitely showing Marvel's modernization into the 21st century, and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments. Cursing is definitely increased in this one, with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue, but not to the point of being overdone. No F bombs, but some of the language has got a little more bite, so caution. In addition, the tone of the tale is darker, and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor, Captain America, and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale, which again is a plus.Some of the political moments:
While nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today, Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film. Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating, ""Look what I had to do,"" was a bit of showboating that I could have done without. Yet even this dislike is marginal, given it's very little occurring, has some nice moments that build off of it, and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in.A Little More Action:The action in this movie is great, and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film, and things I was not expecting. Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced, namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought. However, the fights at the end needed some more time for me, and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time. Star Wars has done this successfully in the past, showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle. Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films, but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt. The battle is lengthy enough, I'll agree to that, but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me.The VERDICT:Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago. A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation, this hero's quest had all the makings of a fun, exciting and swift adventure we were expecting. Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects, was a deeper movie than I had expected, using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose. Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie, and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book, though again caution with your little ones watching it. As for limitations, I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie, but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me. Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them. Overall, my scores for this film are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0-9.5
Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0."
The movie had a generic story but Really cool cinematography and fighting choreography with a couple references to some classic kung fu movies. Acting was good overall with some beautiful synergy between some characters.
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a prime example of consumability over creativity. Because of its formulaic nature, Shang-Chi will be indulged by many and revered by few. Everything about the script can be predicted and, by design, feels similar to its MCU predecessors. Technically, Shang-Chi seems crafted by a board room rather than specialized artists. The direction is indistinguishable, the production design is sterile, and the effects are ambitious but tonally incompatible. There are occasional visual delights but the cinematography is often executed for efficiency over artistry. None of this is necessarily upsetting but it gives Shang-Chi a bland undertone. Ultimately, this movie is competent and universally inoffensive but lacks genuine excitement or freshness.On the positive side, the cast elevates the material. Awkwafina feels perfectly placed, Tony Leung Chiu-wai brings respectability, and Simu Liu is both likable and impressive in his choreography. Some fight scenes are fun, especially Simu Liu's first battle. That fight, in particular, is the most engaging part of the film and feels like a slightly new dynamic for the MCU. Unfortunately, that is all overshadowed by Disney's calculated monotony, leaving Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings to be another forgettable step in Disney's long line of safe bets.* Writing: 5/10

"Very satisfied when watching at the cinema, but still very difficult when watching it at home. At first I underestimated this film, I thought it would be bad, but I was totally wrong. A very good film, the CGI visual effects are very capable and rich. I will watch it for the 2nd time. 9/10 for me. I'm satisfied."
"This is by far the best choreographed MCU film to this point but that by far doesn't mean that this is the best MCU film. Also WenWu is by far one of the best MCU Villains of all time because of how much character development he had throughout the film.The train sequence and the battle ring arena are by far some of the best fight scenes in the entire MCU alongside this Abomination's long awaited return in this film that really helped bring the battle ring arena sequence to life. Alongside this Razor Fist really makes every action scene he's in feel threatening due to his unique appearance and abilities.The only reason why this film only gets a 9/10 in this film is because of how ridiculous the final battle in this film was as it really didn't fit within the film and really felt a lot more like a final showdown in Godzilla Monster battle compared to an MCU film, if they had just used WenWu as the main antagonist for the final battle it would definitely have a 10/10 form me."
"Have you watched a Marvel action superhero movie before?What if you've watched, ALL the Marvel superhero movies?Then you're in for some HOT garbage in this movie, as this was made to order, copying EVERY scene from other Marvel movies.I mean every fight scene just felt like I'd watched it before, except now the characters doing them I had even less connection with. I'm bored with fights on buses and trains and people leaping around scaffolding. Every Marvel movie has a fight scene on a bus or a train, but this one felt REALLY recycled.Getting back round to the characters, besides Shang Chi, I can't remember his sisters name, or his weird friends name, who served zero purpose in the movie, accept serving as a loud mouthed joke teller. It was almost as if they wanted a Kevin Hart like star, but had to settle with Awkwafina? And Shang's sister? Just added nothing to the story or the movie. She looked NOTHING like Shang either, or her younger self, the casting was well off there.Ben Kingsley showing up was amusing, but honestly that was it when it cames to laughs. You could see every joke coming up 30 seconds before it was delivered, because it was a recycled joke from other Marvel superhero movie.Wong and The Abomination make a cameo appearance in this movie, but their addition is given NO CONTEXT, and makes zero sense, and adds nothing to the movie or their own stories.Overall, I'd just say every character felt, just like a Chinese copy or a character you've already seen in a Marvel movie before. By the end, I felt like I had watched a propaganda movie made by the CCP. It was like ordering a Chinese, except it came drowned in a bath of Chinese sauce, served on a bed of soggy Chinese mythology. Even the post credit scene wasn't worth sticking around to watch as it contains Marvel's most hated character to ever get a movie in it."
"I went to watch Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings last night and it does not disappoint at all.This is a character I am not very familiar with in regards to the MCU. However, having watched it, I hope we see more of him sooner rather than later.The film starts with how Shang-Chi's father Wenwu discovered the 10 Rings and used them to topple governments and change the outcome of certain world events. Then how he wants to try and find the mystical village of Tao Lo as this is the last area of the world he hasn't conquered.Eventually finding the entrance to the lost village he finds a young lady guarding the entrance. In time they fall in love and he gives up the 10 Rings to be with her.Cut to 1996 and they're living in married bliss with baby Shang-Chi having been born and his sister soon after. They're given two pendants but their mother as we discover that she was killed and her father took up the 10 Rings again.We then discover a grown up Shang-Chi (Or Shaun as he is now known) living in San Francisco as a car valet with his friend Katy (played brilliantly by the actress Awkwafina). As they're travelling to work on a bus henchmen sent by his father attack him. What follows is a very well choreographed fight seen and lots of destruction.Realising the pendent has been stolen by the henchmen Shaun races back home to his apartment to grab clothes for a flight to Macau. To try and save his sister from losing her pendent.Not wishing to miss out, Katy insists on joining Shaun for the ride. On the flight over Shaun explains he is not the man who Katy thought he was and explains his past.When he arrives in Macau he goes to the address on a postcard which he assumed was sent by his sister. It turns out his sister runs an illegal fight club where huge amounts of betting takes place inside and online.Shaun is already well known thanks to a YouTube video of his exploits in San Francisco going viral. He also finds out he is going to be the main attraction and lots of money has already been bet on him.A fight is already going on and a familiar face is taking part. I will not spoil that bit for you. As he goes into the ring the opponent appears and it turns out to be his sister.Chaos then ensues as the same henchmen have arrived at the illegal fighting den after the second pendent. The fight scenes which take place on scaffolding between Shaun, his sister and his fathers henchmen are breath taking and it really makes you feel as though you're high up on the side of a building.They're eventually captured and taken back to their former home. When it is explained that their dad hears their mum calling to him and he believes she is still alive but being kept captive by the elders in Tao-Lo. He must go and find Tao-Lo but can only find the correct path once a year and that time is soon.Meanwhile he locks all 3 up in a dungeon as they will not help him go and find their mother. What follows is absolutely hilarious as an old character from the Iron Man franchise makes an appearance.While they're in the dungeon they're introduced to a creature from Tao-Lo called Morris and they find out from this creature that there is a much quicker way to get to Tao-Lo. So, stealing a car, they head to the lost village.Upon arriving they meet their Aunt who is also mourning the loss of her sister. They are told about and ancient evil that eats souls and many cities fell to it and was only defeated by the help of a dragon. Shang Chi and Xialing are given dragon scale armor (a gift from their mother). Katy trains with a bow and arrow and Shaun trains with his aunt to learn the dragon magic fighting style.The 10 Rings then attack the village with Shaun fighting his father first on the side of the lake which he is then sent crashing into. While unconscious under water he learns his power can call the guardian dragon.Meanwhile at the entrance of the of the cave where his father believes his mother is calling from. His father can be seen trying to break into the cave. Which eventually releases bat like creatures that suck up the souls of individuals.Continuing to try and release his wife. Wenwu releases the mother of all beasts and a battle ensues. Sadly we see Wenwu killed as his soul is sucked out by one of the bat like creatures. But, not before himself and Shaun battle it out against each other. Upon his death, the 10 Rings are passed on to Shaun. The battle comes to an end and the villagers mourn the loss of those lost in battle.We then get taken back to San Francisco where Shaun and Katy are telling their story to two friends who look at them as though they're going mad and in fact one complains that she is having the mickey taken out of her.The closing scene sees a popular character appear and both Shaun and Katy follow them. Which gives a clue I suspect as to how phase 4 will pan out in the future of the MCU.There are two closing credit scenes. One where we find both Shaun and Katy in a building and other Marvel characters have appeared. Again, this shows where the MCU is going.The second involves his sister.. but that is all I will reveal as this will also show what I think is going to be the direction of the MCU.There are little snippets within the film that also mention past events. Can you hear and find them?Overall this is a brilliant film! Some very good special effects. The music score is good. Some very funny characters too. I think this is a very good start to Phase 4 and miles better than Black Widow.As my title suggests please ignore the 1 * reviews on here. I suspect they're DC fans in disguise trying to make MCU look bad. But, by all means read them and make up your own mind by going to watch Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
Best Marvel movie in the recent times! Great action and just enough humour rather than the usual Marvel OTT. Strong character development makes them relatable and connected. Nice pace with beautiful fight scenes. Impressive overall!
Shang chi and the legend of ten rings i good can help Marvel's 4th phase to get better.
"Overall, the movie was worth a watch. A lot of pretty scenery and great fight scenes. It is just getting ridiculous how the directors and production companies are not caring about the movie quality anymore, as long as they get their messages out. You can tell the director and writer have never picked up a Marvel Comic. They way they try to make you see that this movie is tied into the Marvel Universe is ludicrous. I see the writers all sitting around someone who got themselves in the group because daddy works at a higher level. No experience whatsoever.""Let's see, I have an idea. Ok hear me out. Wong, Wong is Asian so lets make sure he makes an appearance. That makes great sense to me. Now what reason would Wong have to fight in a place you wouldn't find anyone as honorable as he is, to be hanging out. Ok, let's don't explain that people will just get it because he is Asian, right? Ok now who would he fight in the ""Look here I am to connect this movie to us"" scene? Oh, I got it. Abomination. Ya that makes total sense to me. I mean, Wong was just minding his business one day, and Abomination stopped by because he was in the area and wanted to know if he wanted to go fishing. Wong said sure, let me open up a portal to the lake and we will go. Oh, my. My portal got messed up. How did we get to an illegal fight club in China? Ok, I guess while we are here, we will sign up to fight each other, since I just forgot how to open my portals. (Oh No!) Fight, Fight, Fight. Ok Abomination I am going to make you punch yourself. Hands through the portal, my favorite trick. Works all of the time. Ouch, Wong. That hurt. Oh but guess what Abomination. When you took that hit, it woke me up to remember how to open my portals again. Let's go home, shall we. Ok Wong, let's go.That is it. It would rival the greats. I am a genius.No you are an idiot. Actually, you may just have bad taste. The hiring people at Marvel are idiots and the people that give final approval, are no better.Well, we had a good first round of Marvel movies for 20 years. The millennium generation is taking over, so it is all downhill from here. Dang."
"I really dont get why this movie gets all this praise.....
It starts fine with some fine marshall arts and a drop of humor. Then its slows down on to exposition hell for a while full hour, before it rounds of with a weak climaxOne of the weakest MCU movies together with Black widow, Thor 2, Antman.2 and The hulk if it counts."
"Generally speaking, the story has nothing special to me, but still good and solid. What I really find outstanding are many of the action scenes. The action and CGI in the final act are amazing, definitely one of the best in the entire MCU.I'd like to point out the soundtrack, it's really good."
"Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.There's a satisfying origin story here, with a few small appearances from familiar characters that add spice to a host of new characters who are all quite compelling right out of the gate.The action's great, and there's also so much of it- I liked how lots of the action felt relatively grounded by MCU standards, with neat stunt work and exciting camerawork making the action pop (it's only the final battle that gets really CGI heavy).The humour's also more consistent than most Marvel films, with most of the jokes landing. Also cool were all the fantasy elements and creatures- they were all pretty inventive and well-executed.I will say the one notable flaw is that there's a lot of exposition in the film's second half, but they get around that a little by having great actors like Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh do most of the explaining (and there is a lot to explain, with this being a whole new side of the MCU and all), so it's not super noticeable."
"I'm not gonna lie. The movie didn't impress me much based on the trailer. I still wanted to see it because, well, Marvel movies are just fine and I believed it would be good. And it was. It was. The story, in my opinion, wasn't as good as it usually is with Marvel. Not that Marvel has any masterful storylines, but it just wasn't as good in my opinion as some of the other movies that have come out from the studio in the past. What was more than good, on the other hand, was the music in places. But what was without a doubt the best and what Marvel has always been able to do and probably always will be able to do is action. The action scenes here are awesome, although then they are not very frequent. There are a few times when the pace slows down and we wait for some of the fights. Once it does though, you're in for an epic CGI load of fighting that I devoured. There's still the occasional quirk thrown in here and there, as is usually the case with Marvel movies. To sum it up. For me, a good movie that I recommend, and classically to Marvel fans."
"This is a beautiful movie; visual and filled with soul. Although it's your standard Marvel stop-the-bad-guys film, that aspect is overshadowed by the great family story. The ""villain"" has purpose that makes you resonate with his desire - and the actor delivers that perfectly. Entire cast is great. Awkwafina is the normal person thrown into the foray , Simu Liu might be a newcomer for most but as a Toronto resident, I'm bias and rooting for him. Film is clean, great for family. And for those long time Marvel cinematic watchers, yes it does tie into the big picture."
"Definitely a great Marvel movie. Great story, marvelous cast, you can't miss a beat!"
"Best marvel solo movie must watch in theaters.Action scenes are awesome, characters are good and post-credit scene will give goosebumps."
"This Movie was AMAZING ,beautiful to look at and had awesome action scenes as well as gripping story that at times even pulled on your heart strings. This is hands down one of the best MARVEL films that's ever come out so far. WOW, WHAT A DARN MOVIE!!!!"
"The film has some of the most engaging fight scenes of any Marvel movie that came before, courtesy of the late Brad Allan (Kingsman). They feel so fluid, stylish and clear. It was perfect.The Asian representation is also a welcome addition to the Marvel Universe. They've done it successfully before with African Culture in Black Panther and here, it's just as good. Who knows what this might bring to the Comic Book Genre in the future? Maybe we could get a proper Cassandra Cain and Lady Shiva adaptation?Unfortunately, the comedy here is bad, though not as bad as Black Widow. There is one moment though, where the comedy ends up being the worst in the MCU. On a plane, Shang Chi recalls his past to Katy and we are treated to engaging flashbacks. The drama and emotion are there.......and then the stewardess interrupts them by asking if they want either vegetarian or beef, killing the mood completely. It's those moments that I hate the most in the entire MCU that kill off any potential drama, moments like Gamora kicking Starlord in Avengers Endgame, the destruction of Asgard being played for laughs in Thor Ragnarok, etc.The pacing is kind of slow.The character development is also a problem as we don't really see enough development of Shang-Chi himself, as he's sidelined in favor of Katy or Shang-Chi's sister. He does get some development but it's not enough.On the positive side though, the acting is good, it's well cast, it's well shot, and we finally got an actual Mandarin but that's about it."
Definitely worth the ticket! Great action and fight plots.
"Excellent Marvel movie that teaches us the history of Shang-Chi. The fight scenes are grand, the story fascinating, and the other scenes are divine. In short, a magical film."
"The new Marvel Super Hero film, SHANG-CHI and the LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is the kind of film that deserves to be seen on the big screen and Writer/Director Destin Daniel Cretton (JUST MERCY) has crafted a film that earns that statement.Based on the Marvel comic book character (of course), SHANG-CHI tells the tale of...well...Shang-Chi a financially struggling - but happy - Valet in San Francisco who has a family secret.Writer/Director Cretton has crafted a whimsical, mythological, mystical and action packed film that settles in at the top end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe family of films.At the center, newcomer Simu Liu (KIM'S CONVENIENCE) more than holds his own as the newest Super Hero in the MCU. He is grounded, centered and more sure than unsure as he discovers his abilities and his family's secrets. He is a worthy addition to this world of Superheroes.Joining him is the remarkable Awkwafina (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) as his best friend, sidekick who handles the drama comedy and action with aplomb. This film makes some smart choices with this character and Awkwafina shines.The rest of the cast/characters are equally as strong from Tony Chi-Wai Leung (as Shang-Chi's father) to Meng'er Zhang (as Shang-Chi's sister) and good ol' Michelle Yeoh (as Shang-Chi's Aunt) bring strong characters to life. They all shine.This film also brings back a character from a previous MCU film that somewhat redeems the poorly conceived character from his earlier appearance. I won't spoil it by saying who it is, but I liked what the MCU did with this character.But, this being a Marvel movie, all of these performances anchor a bigger picture that is filled with action, action and more action - and something else, something mystical.Here is where Director Cretton really shines. The action scenes are interestingly staged and choreographed well. The first fight (the bus fight that is shown in the trailer) and a fight on scaffolding both particularly work well.This film does delve into the mystical in the last 1/3 and in Cretton's hands, this ends up working well instead of being comical or inane. I bought what was going on and was rooting for our heroes to defeat the undefeatable, fantastical creatures.To be honest, the ""final battle"" didn't really live up to the rest of the film so that brings this film down a notch, but this movie did what it needed it to do, it opened up a whole new area of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - in both character and locations - and I am anxious to see where they go from here.Try to see SHANG-CHI on the Big Screen, the visuals are worth it.Letter Grade A- (the finale needed to be better)8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
"The movie is more like an action movie than a superhero one.The action are visual treat for audience but the storyline is not.However, considering the character introduction, it is still a good movie to watch.But certainly not the best MCU character introduction.Some animation scenes are really beautiful and the eastern mythology is always an inspiration."
"Wasn't expecting much due to the recent Black Widow experience, but was fairly surprised by the quality of this film. The storyline is still the cliche origin story, but this one has good action sequences, good character building, good exploration into the core ideas of our culture, good representation of some of the mythical beens in it, actors speaking actual Mandarin Chinese not some weird ones with alien accents that Hollywood used to think is Chinese. Phase 4 of MCU looks a bit more promising after this. A solid 6 for pass.1 more star for Leung Chiu-Wai, this is one of those where the ""villain"" is more likeable than the protagonist. Without his performance this whole thing would have been so mundane."
"The martial art scenes that aren't full of cgi are beautiful and a nice tribute to old cinema. But after that it breaks down. It's a predictable cgi fest, with mediocre characters.I thought Awakafina was great, everyone else was average. Though it was meant to be a martial arts superhero film, it ended up just a marvel film.I enjoyed it. But it was forgettable, and sorry to mention it again but the cgi got on my nerves. The dragons and stuff where ok cgi but got repetitive.Overall worth watching, but noting special. Except the martial arts where beautiful."
"This is a good movie I'm not denying that -- there's amazing CGI, good music and a very promising premise. For the first half the movie does great. But the second half seems very weak. The characters start making whimsical decisions and the story starts feeling very rushed. I really wish they could have kept it together though. The movie was slower than most Marvel movies and I was liking that fact too."
"Absolutely enjoyed the film from first to last.... truly aa blockbuster.Must watch film...
At another blockbuster from Marvel studios."
"This movie had amazing visuals, awesome fight scenes, and great and lovable characters. All in all this movie is very enjoyable and should be experienced on the big screen."
"Shang-Chi will likely be heralded as the ""Chinese Black Panther,"" but in truth, this is the film Black Panther wants to be when it grows up. Easily top-5 in the MCU, and probably competes with Guardians of the Galaxy for my favorite of the bunch.There are several nods to the wider universe, and if you're a die-hard fan, they'll be quite rewarding, but they never distract from this mostly self-contained story.This movie is at times seriously, laugh-out-loud funny, but it never falls into the trap of allowing humor to undermine its emotional moments. Ben Kingsley and Awkwafina give particularly standout performances. And if the latter's, shall we say, overt comedic style can get grating for you, know that not only does she deliver it in small doses, but she also has some surprisingly heartfelt moments, too.Perhaps the most spectacular feature of this movie is its stuntwork. There are multiple incredibly long, exceedingly well-choreogrphed fight scenes. There are some which are the most creative, crazy, acrobatic fights since Jackie Chan's glory days in Hong Kong Cinema. Others take clear inspiration from the dance-like wirework of Wuxia films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, even borrowing one of its lead actors for one of them. Throughout, the camerawork is clear, without the rapid-fire cutting that pervades much of Hollywood. The cinematography at times takes wide angles to really showcase, rather than mask, its stunt performers. At other times, the cameraman is treated as another performer, right in the heart of the acrobatic choreography.While the the practical stunts will get lots of attention, the visual effects are just as beautiful, taking full advantage of the blockbuster budget. There are elemental effects that prove that a live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender movie could work. There are creatures that range from cute, cuddly animals to monsters that would make Kaiju films jealous. This movie even pulls off the difficult trick of making energy-based sci-fi weapons seem raw and visceral.In the center of all this spectacle is a surprisingly resonant personal story about a broken family. Tony Leung gives an incredible performance, making a millenia-old, super-powered warlord not just sympathetic, but even relatable. The titular character embodies one of the film's central themes of bringing together aspects of disparate influences to forge a unique identity. The other lead has a similar story, but hers is arguably even more compelling.All in all, Shang-Chi is a film that does just about everything right, and it does so while bringing its own fresh take, not just to the MCU, but to Hollywood filmmaking in general. They really knocked it out of the park with this one."
"I have seen almost every Marvel movie, and so far this is the only one I plan to rewatch. It's just a little bit of a shame Tony Leung's character dies so we won't be seeing him in the MCU anymore."
"Though this film had quite lame and straightforward storyline but it's amazing direction, fantastic acting by all the cast members, beautiful visuals and cgi work, action sequences and the balance between humor and emotion makes it 10 times better film and a treat for marvel fans. It carries a great potential for the future of the MCU. For me this is the best film of 2021 until now and I truly enjoyed it and hope to see Shang Chi more in the MCU."
Shang-chi is amazing. That's all I have to say purr.
BLOCKBUSTER in block capital letters. What a movie. Amazing experience and great CGI.
This movie was start to finish pure entertainment and it did not disappoint. Beautiful choreography and visually stunning. O and that ending wow it was like a dance of visual effects almost mind-numbingly Beautiful like a trance hats off to everyone involved in this 100% pure entertainment.
"Let me just say I didn't know what to expect going into this movie, but I'm glad I bought the tickets. The story was amazing and the fighting scenes were really good choreographed and just overall top tier camerawork, the actor who played him is amazing and the movie was amazingly funny definitely worth watching."
It's fun to see actors from other movies. Grand master and crouching tiger hidden dragon.
"This was a powerful film for Asians everywhere, as Marvel takes into an era of inclusion and expansion.Story wise, Shang Chi was good, not great, but solid. Displays Asian values perfectly. I found a few of the Chinese lines irritating to hear, as a native Mandarin speaker.The martial arts sequences were simply amazing. Fights scenes were captivating and beautiful, with superb special affects on top of the actual martial arts. With the Eternals coming up, Marvel is clearly upping its CGI and special affects making much more cinematographic films.My only complaint was the ending, went from one of Marvel's best into Godzilla. I don't think you'll find anyone praising it. A weak ending for an overall amazing film."
"POSITIVES1. Action and funny scenes
2. Characters
3. Mystical creaturesNEGATIVES1. Darkness
2. Speed of story fluctuate
3. If ten rings have been there for 1000 years, then why not show it earlier in other fights?"
"How can anyone give such a movie a 5/10 or below??? Really?! It's stunningly beautiful in its very own way, the kung fu, the humor, the visuals, the atmosphere, everything, SO GOOD! I'm just gonna leave it to that! Please go watch it and please ignore the bad reviews. People are so stupid that they just don't know what a good movie is anymore smh."
"Where to start, I'll start by saying the choreography is the best in any movie ever made, easily, the cinematography and colouring is also effing fantastic, Simu pulled off a fantastic performance of amazing martial arts, a goofy dude who wasn't annoying, and pulled off emotional scenes very well, CGI was fantastic, the motivations for the plot were as well, I don't think it's perfect because there were some pacing issues, I felt a little bored in the third act for some reason, maybe it was a result of being tired to be honest so that's not they're fault. Great movie.TINY TINY SPOILER ABOUT POST CREDIT SCENES
But I did leave with a bad taste in my mouth because the critics said the post credit scenes were endgame level hype and I was so excited, expected Tobey and/or Andrew, or some x-men, spoiler alert, not even close, wasn't that good. So that is not the movies fault, just lower your credit scene expectations if you're freaking out about it."
"I really loved this movie. I'll admit, there's a lot left to be explained (where the rings came from, who the mom is, etc), but the director and producers definitely got the chemistry, humor, and acting right.The movie is just so jam packed with action. Even with a complex story line, it had a lot of action (usually complex story lines have a lot of lead in and are slow to warm up, but this definitely was not the case). And after watching Michelle Yeong be Miss Mean Mom-in-law in Crazy Rich Asians, it was so beautiful and wonderful to see her as nurturing auntie and just a complete bad-ass with her martial arts (I missed her days of Crouching Tiger, I'll admit).Simu Liu was beyond amazing. His chemistry, humor, and not to mention the way he kicked ass on screen, was so damn entertaining. And finally, a movie where AAPI are the heroes. What else could I ask for? The cherry on top was Awkwafina's blunt ass humor and the way she broke uncomfortable silences with her awkwardness. Gotta love it.I'd definitely see this movie again. One of the best Marvel movies I've seen thus far. I can't wait to see where the story line goes, what's up with the sister, and I mean...with Wong being there, Dr. Strange's future appearance is inevitable. I can't wait!!! Such a great cliffhanger."
"An awesome action adventure fantasy movie with great comedic timing and a compelling storyline and character arc. One of the best marvel origin story's ever. Satisfying climax and one of the best choreography ever. Great CGI, music, and cinematography. A great compelling storyline that leaves you on the edge of your seat. The villain and hero have a great relationship that leaves you with mixed feelings about the good vs hero Dynamic. In the end awesome film."
Top 5 greatest marvel movies ever made. The choreography of the fights are beautiful. The cgi is beautiful the story is beautiful. Just watch it.
"This movie was stunning. From the visual effects to the heart of the story to the phenomenal cast. I laughed, I cried and sat on the edge of my seat. Well worth taking the risk during the pandemic to go see this one in the theater. The music was great as well. Will definitely buy it when it comes out for rewatch. One of the best Marvel movies IMO."
"After being burned by Mulan last year, I went into this film with very low expectations, but was delighted to find this movie was wonderful to watch. Tony Leung, as the misguided villain trying to resurrect his wife and Shaun's mother, is the breakout star here, and his storyline - along with Leung's acting - is so magnificent that it sort of overshadows the other characters, including Shaun. This film is exciting, yet also heartwarming."
Watched the movie on release date and wasnt sure as I didnt see much advertisement on it. But I can say the movie was amazing. The characters casted worked well for the. But my favourite had to be Trevor!!
A must watch for MCU fans and fans of martial arts movies.
"Just as some amazing marvel movies like Black Panther, Ant-man or Guardians of the Galaxy this movie takes a fresh take on the super hero formula. It may be at it's core the same: hero goes to a journey to learn and defeat the bad guy but it doesn't stop there and pushes it further. Antagonists have their legit reason to be bad and not just for the sake of ""I'm bad because yes"".Great cast, everyone made good performance. Really liked Tony Leung as the Mandarin, he can show lovely traits as a father figure and also a very scary/powerful one."
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Seven Rings tells the story of a young man named Xu Shang-Chi who has to confront his past after confronting an organization run by his dad, Xu Wenwu. After obtaining the Ten Rings, Wenwu is given immortality and the power to overthrow governments through different times, but he falls in love with a woman from the village in a magical forest. After Shang-Chi's mom's death, Wenwu wants to find a way to revive her in the village, but Shang-Chi and his sister need to stop him and his army from causing further destruction.As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew that Shang-Chi was a film I had to see. Everything in the film was right up my alley. Martial Arts, dragons, other strange creatures, cool visuals and magic. The fact that this was a Marvel film did not really cross my mind. This looked like the perfect kind of movie see on the big screen. How does it stack up to the other Marvel films?The story to Shang-Chi is pretty typical when it comes to adventure films like this. What makes it work is that it focuses on building the characters throughout the film and giving the right balance of action and development for the film. It also helps that there is less humor here than in most Marvel films. It takes itself much more seriously as the origin story of Shang-Chi. That being said, the comedic moments here are really funny. They are perfectly timed for the most part and they are clever. The pacing is pretty solid too. It is not too fast nor too slow. The world-building is more vast than I thought it would be. There are creatures, powers, weapons and magic everywhere here as well as a magical forest. It all fits in nicely to the story. My only complaint about the story is that Xialing could have used more development or screen time. She has less to do than the other main characters and I really wanted to know more about her and how she built the underground fighting ring. Overall, the story is good.The performances are great and they elevate the characters. You can tell how excited Simu Liu was for this movie. He shows his passion in every scene he is in. Not only does he do great with the dialogue and the reactions, but he is a great fighter too. He was perfect for the role and he came off as a very natural protagonist who just wants to reunite with his family, but do the right thing. Shang-Chi is also a good character because he learned to be a good fighter without the rings, but not to the point where he was invincible. The movie also has Awkwafina as Katy who is a fun addition that adds some lighthearted scenes for a rather dark film while still being part of the action and getting serious when she needs to. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing is quite good as well. She comes of as incredibly powerful as she commands every scene she is in. Her backstory is pretty tragic with how her father treated her. I really want to see more from her in future MCU projects because her running an underground fight club is one of the most interesting parts about this movie.Then there is Tony Leung as Shang-Chi's father, also the villain. While I still think Kilmonger and Vulture are the best MCU villains, Xu Wenwu makes for a great villain. He is one of those villains who definitely needs to be stopped and you root for the protagonists over, but you can also stop and sympathize with him. He legitimately loved his family and he started to become destructive after a tragedy in the family. It also helps that he thinks he is bringing the family together when he is actually tearing it apart further, adding an extra element of sympathy or tragedy to his character. Leung's performance makes Wenwu's character so human that I was actually rooting for him to turn good by the end of the film. He makes him not just the leader of the Ten Rings, but as a normal father raising his kids with his wife. These moments show why it is important to give villains depth in their motivations and backgrounds and it is why Wenwu makes for one of the better MCU villains.The visuals in this movie are insane. This is easily the best looking Marvel film by a long shot. It has some stunning and inventive cinematography as well as some great special effects. What really got me excited were the awesome action scenes in the film. There are plenty of martial arts fights here and they have great stunt work and camerawork making them so fun to watch. The power of the Seven Rings looks really cool and made the fights even more fun to watch. And then the climax came and gave me what I wanted... I will not say much, but it is one of the most exciting fights in the MCU. This movie also has an incredibly memorable and catchy musical theme. It is easily the best score in a Marvel film.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Seven Rings is really good. I think even people who do not like Marvel would get into this film. Not only does it have the best visuals and action of a Marvel film, but it also has a really good story with some likable and relatable characters.As usual with a Marvel film, stay through the credits."
"As famed YouTuber Ryan George would put it, Wow (x4). This is simply an amazing movie with spectacular production value. I was thoroughly entertained throughout its duration. And I think most people will be, too. Definitely one of the best Marvel movies out there. Oh, and definitely stick around for the mid and post-credit scenes, they are totally worth it."
"10/10 because of Morris. Morris is the best character and the best part about this movie, along with Trevor. Would watch again because of Morris."
This movie is easily in my top 5 favorite MCU movies!!
"This movie is perfect in many ways. It makes you want to see it again and again. The action and CGI are perfect. The actors too. The only problem with that movie is that I felt like the dragon part was unnecessary. Other than that, the movie is perfect."
Best movie of the year 2021 and I will say this is a must watch movie. Best one üëç
It's an awesome movie and the best superhero movie of this year till now. I liked it.
"Watched it in Dbox/3D and i just got to say, if i didn't have a kid i'd be back. Beautiful movie and was a nice change. Was excited to see a few in there from the previous marvel movies."
Amazing homage to classic Chinese martial arts films. Truly a joy to watch and visual experience to soak in.
"This is one of the best Marvel films. Great visual arts, great story, wonderful family film. Awesome movie."
"Wow, this movie was honestly a lot better than I thought it'd be. The action was well done, had good humor, and had a good story with great CGI in it. I was engaged throughout it. The acting was good and believable, especially by the antagonist. I'm impressed and proved wrong, I didn't expect a movie of this level. Not impressed by the soundtrack, but that doesn't take away much from the experience."
"This movie has everything you'd expect from a top tier Marvel film. Great Action, Great Humor, Great Casting, Great Effects and a good story.People less likely to enjoy this movie:
1. DC fanboys, because it's easily better than ANYTHING the DCU has put out and they just hate that.2. Xenophobes, because 95% of the cast is Asian (obviously)3. Chauvinists, because it has several strong female characters4. MAGA, see 2&35. Comic book purists, because the characters and storylines don't follow the comic books to the extent they insist it should.If you don't fall into any of these categories. You should really enjoy this film."
"The fight sequences, the bgm,the vfx omg,the story and the emotion everything was top notch
Loved the movie every inch
#shang-chi üî•üî•üî•"
"I really liked this movie. The story was good, so were the fights and effects. Also, how can you not love Simu Liu? I love him from Kim's Convenience but he blew me away in this. Canada proud! <3."
"I grew up in Japan watching tons Jackie Chan movies and Kung-fu flicks. I can assure you this is a kung-fu movie a fantasy film.I don't think Marvel went into this genre. Disney implementation to Marvel works so well with this one.Fresh characters and legendary kung-fu actors altogether makes the world so complete.I really like the cinematography. The latter half of the movie is visually stunning. All the action sequences are solid and fast forward and still you can all take in the elements of them.Watching legendary kung-fu actress, Michelle Yeoh, on big screen just brought tears to my eyes with joy.And reprise of the character from previous marvel franchise makes this movie so much fun above all that.I'd definitely recommend watch this at theater with your friends and families. You'd miss out so much detail if you were to wait for streaming to come out.This is made for true movie theater experience.Enjoy the ride."
"Firstly, I went into this with high expectations and the movie did not disappoint at all, I've gotten pretty much everything that I wanted from this film and more.Secondly, the story is explained with great care and it introduces the audience with amazing, new and fleshed out characters that really elevate this film to another level.Furthermore, the cast is exceptional and I couldn't have imagined any other cast to represent these characters. This reminded me of how the original Avengers were perfectly cast for their roles. That said, I really have absolutely nothing bad to say about the cast. They played some distinct characters compared to the rest of the MCU with their set of quirks, stories, backgrounds and lives in general.The only small complaint that I had while watching this movie was that the movie had spent a good portion of its runtime dwelling in the past about certain characters.All in all, excellent movie with ton of flavor, great cast and amazing characters in a very dynamic story! Would definitely recommend seeing!"
"What a wonderful movie. It had great action, beauty, sadness, happiness and funny. The martial arts where awesome and beautiful. The was a wonderful story line. Welcome to The Marvel Universe Shang-Chi, we're looking forward to seeing you again."
It was a rollercoaster ride all along. I'm not a big MCU fan but this one has to be respected..Shang-chi gave different vibes every 10 min. After a few laughs a serious scene comes long and in the middle again a laughing moment...it was a fresh movie to watch and would surely recommend it.
This new Marvel movie is so outstanding.Post credit scene is mind blowing. I am shocked. I waiting next part of shangchi movie.No spoilers.Anyone request go and watch inthis new movie Marvel universe.
"Not gonna lie I had fewer expectations; but since it's marvel studios, things turned out to be a lot better than I expected. Action sequences with martial arts are enjoyable and jaw-dropping. The cinematography, camera work, editing, and BGM are impressive so are the performances. Though not much of an exceptional storyline but will keep you invested throughout. Highly recommended and a great reason to get back to the theatre again! ‚ù§"
"Hilarious, amazing special effects, great cast, strong villain and very powerful and a great performance from Awkwafina and really, really funny with great callback with Wong and hilarious performance from Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery. An overall brilliant movie. Great film."
"The MCU's newest movie has the same things the other movies in the series have-by that i mean great humour, great action scenes, and just the fun factor that makes all of the movies so beloved. The film feels like it has a couple of 'acts', and each has something else to offer. The action scenes are very fun to watch and the fight scenes are really well choreographed. There are a lots of nice looking locations and colors in the film, and it has a nice Asian feel to it. There are also great quiet scenes between Shaung and his family. The characters are great, Shaung and his sister being warriors with troubled lives, their father being determined to bring back his wife back despite what his son says, and Katy, Trevor and Morris are all really hilarious. Also, the movie is just fun to watch. I largely reccomend it."
"After a long time, everyone, especially the Marvel Studios' fans has a chance to watch their latest movie in theatres. And to be honest they will be pleased and they SHOULD watch this in theatres. You will get everything you need from a Marvel flick.Shang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings gives a new look at a new hero. It's fresh and it's entertainment at best. To start with positive aspects, the performance as usual are Good. Marvel never misses their castings. Everyone gave their best. Especially the leads Liu and Lueng. Both portrayed themselves perfectly. I was expecting Awkwafina to be a cringe, but she didn't disappointed. Action just brilliant, flawless. The screenplay is elegant. Seeing what new Marvel is showing and what more is about to come will crave fans and everyone for more. Especially the concept of Ten Rings. The mysticism and spiritual material is displayed brilliantly. Fantasy at it's peak. The CGI is just.. flawless as usual. Works tooo damn neat.The bad aspects of the movie I consider is the Wenvu's (Leung) unsatisfactory agenda. He's clearly a brilliant intimidating villian but with his agenda, he seems nothing but a Delusional guy. The Wong and Abomination arc shown in the trailers fails to deliver any justice. The guy, so they say ""Death Dealer"" was supposed to be a prominent badass, but they wasted his potential. And Marvel can't keep re-using the formula of ""Big Third Act"", ""Good vs. Evil"", with loads of CGI, they have to use and start giving new screenplays for climax. (also the last thing with Katy being sudden Hawkeye in the climax is just.. facepalm. No way they did that!)Nevertheless, the movie works fine. Along with superb cinematography, good direction and decent background score. Go watch this movie, you'll enjoy and have a good time. Must watch. Not a definite Marvel Masterpiece, but works and balances well with Humor and Outstanding Action.Shang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings: 4/5 Stars."
"The movie starts with a beautifully narrated and visually stunning story. This is always important to engage the audience from the first moment. This becomes a norm throughout the film.Marvel films are well known for their pop culture references but this movie does not fall into the trap of putting in references just for the sake of it. There is a perfect balance of comedic relief and heartfelt moments.The characters are well constructed, especially Shang-Chi, Xialing and the Mandarin. However, I felt that Katy lacked depth.The movie ended strongly with conflicting feelings about the antagonist. The movie leaves you thinking about it days after it ends.I would definitely rate this among the best marvel movies of all time, and a very good movie overall!"
"The movie should be renamed to ""Wenwu and the Legend of the Ten Rings""."
My opinion is very legendary fight and super movie.
Fantastic movie. This is a great addition to the Marvel universe. Can't wait to see what's next.
"Shang-Chi is definitely not marvel's best film as with most marvel orgin stories but should be a welcome and very likeable character in the MCUThe good.The action was amazing and beautiful choreography
The editing was flawless and was shot excellently
Simu Liu and Awkwafina presented likeable character
The world buildingThe decent.The villain could have been more fleshed out
The story wasnt the greatest
The acting was....thereOverall I would say the story started out great and slowly crawled it's way to the finish lineGood movie but once again not marvel's best."
"It's simply of the best MCU origin story along with ironman, black panther, and Gotg, the character development was great, Cinematography was unique and definitely created a new style of scenery in the MCU, while the fight choreography blew my mind and it is by far the best fight sequence MCU has to offer since Winter soldier, and the CGI was top tier even though it's a martial arts movie it blended in perfectly, and the performances of the actors and actresses was on point, and having a good villain is not really common in the MCU but in this movie you will actually care for the villain and his backstory unlike most of the villains the MCU has produced, hence this is why I think it's one of the most iconic and one of the best hero origin story and movie out there."
"One of the real standouts for me in the movie was the fights scenes. The MCU is not really known for having interesting fight scenes and really most of them are just bland and clich√© but Shang-Chi brought something new and I loved it. Every single fight scene was so well done and paced super well and Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed this, did an amazing job directing the fight scenes in this movie. The fight scenes in this movie were probably the best part especially since you can tell that all of the actors in this movie, especially Simu Liu, did most of the stunt work themselves. It's also insane to think that other than this movie Simu Liu has only really acted in one other thing but you could barely tell. He played Shang-Chi so well and brought so much emotion that everybody can easily relate to and love him. Honestly, everybody did an amazing job acting in this movie and I have to say I was skeptical with Awkwafina, who plays Katy, but she proved me wrong. But for me, the real scene-stealer was Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, who plays Xu Wenwu, as the villain. The villains in Marvel movies are mediocre at best but he decided to change that with this movie. Xu Wenwu was such an intriguing villain that the audience can easily sympathize with and relate to him. The cinematography in this movie is gorgeous to look at and you can see the detail that was put into it. Depending on where the movie is at the lighting reflects that area. I will say though is that this movie has a bit of slower pacing that at times does work in its favour but in other parts, I very much was wanting the movie to hurry up. In the end, Shang-Chi is such a heartfelt Marvel movie that does have some issues but is still enjoyable."
It was amazing the fights the ten rings everything just wow.
"Like able. Not perfect, but oozing charm and fun. Akwafina's character doesn't have much of an arc but she's fun. Shang is a great lead and is fun. Some aspects feel not fleshed out enough but the good pacing helps me forget that.It's fun. It's not the most intricately shaped or crafted story but it's good enough.8/10 not enough Wong."
"Very impressive debut for a superhero flick coming in from the cold! In a competitive landscape of Marvel leads, Simu Liu is a likeable hero and Akwafina is a great foil. Superb supporting cast and very good writing (and production notes, iykwim). This one has legs, and unlikely to shrink in an ensemble."
"The people who give the movie a 1-4/10 reviews are having an agenda against this movie, and they are not honest or objective about it at all.The comic version of the mandarin is different, the power of the ten rings are different, does it make he movie bad? Not at all.The ""Marvel formula"" is present here, but it shows a different part of the MCU and it is just like the Black Panther, an important part of world building.The theme of the movie is about family, i expected it focused more on the action, but it had a unique balance between the story telling and the action scenes, you get them both at the same time and it makes sense.I write this review only because it is a very petty thing to downplay or misrepresent a movie just because of an agenda, and i see that a lot nowdays.The actors were good, the mandarin, Tony Leung Chiu-Wai was the main reason i watched this movie and he did not disappointed me.Should you watch this movie? I think you can enjoy this movie, it is not a ""masterpeice"" but it holds its own weight just fine."
"PHENOMENAL! Absolutely phenomenal! I was worried going into this movie wondering how Shang Chi was going to fit into the MCU. By the 23rd minute... I had a fair idea. By the finale, it was crystal clear. The doors of what is possible in the MCU has been truly kicked off it's hinges!Guaranteed come Monday morning, kids around the world will be busting their parents chops to get into a Martial Art class. Marvels newest addition to the live action roster will have the same impact as Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan had on many here growing up. It's a certainty.Action scenes are aplenty and jaw dropping. I have seen way too many Martial Art movies but this for sheer creativity is up there with the best. Score is beautifully written. Story although predictable, does what it needs to do without grinding the movie to a halt. Acting is top notch especially with the lead Simu Liu and Tony Leung Chui-wai.If I had one bad thing to say about it, it's this... I had to procrastinate either going to the toilet or urinating myself on the seat! Yes it moves that fast. An extremely easy 10/10.Phase 4 is off to a flyer!"
"This movie was absolutely phenomenal! The acting, the fight choreography, the visuals, the villain, the lore, the story it was all superb! I went into this movie only seeing the first teaser so I didn't really know what to expect. What I got was an beautifully crafted epic journey that made me surprisingly emotional at some parts which was very welcomed for a marvel film. My main worry was awkwafina because I really can't stand her as an actress but man she was GREAT in this.veryone was pretty great."
Absolute piece of marvel..though story line is predictable it's well scripted with high visual effects..must watch to experience the power of ten rings.
I dont enjoy marvel movies anymore but this plot was enjoyable since it wasnt as predictable.
"This film contains everything you hope for in a marvel movie. Acting, direction, cinematography, music everything has perfectly blended in this film. Martial arts action sequences with magical mythical creatures and comedic sequences and family sentiments, it is a complete package. It has created a new look to marvel from other movies, and it is one of the best marvel movies. Definitely marvel phase 4 movies are gonna be lit, and this movie has done a great job in introducing it."
"Don't believe positive reviews that try to hype up this movie. Unlike them, i actually went to cinema to watch it and it was possibly most generic mcu movie i have ever seen. Just cause movie has some cool new visual effects, doesn't automatically mean it has depth or interesting characters."
It was ok not much of a plot a lot of action. The whole movie seemed like it was adding up to another movie.
"Expected a superhero movie, got a child's Disney flick. Good for anyone 14 and under, otherwise it was pretty bland, boring and cheesy. Looks like Marvel has finally lost their touch.If you liked Disney's new 'Star Wars' you will like this, otherwise don't bother."
"I had a good time watching the movie, i thought it was a little slow at times and that created some pacing issues for me but it wasnt anything to bad. I thought there were some things they could've done better but overall the movie was enjoyable to watch."
"I can tell you the reason to see this film is solely based on the performance of the incredible Hong Kong actor Tony Leung as Shang-Chi's father Wenwu aka the real MANDARIN. He literally carried this film on his back. For those who aren't film buffs, Tony Leung is basically Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington and Brad Pitt combined in Hong Kong. Even though Hollywood has knocked on his door a few times, finally, better late than never, he gets his due in Hollywood.Simu Liu throughout most of the film, I thought was alright, nothing too special, nothing too terrible. However, he has two incredible moments in the film where then I was completely sold on his character. A great display of acting, one of which involves a scene with Tony Leung where he calls out his failure as a parent. What I also admired is that Shang-Chi also has blood on his hands. He reveals this to Awkwafina's Katy and Simu doesn't overdo his performance in that scene. You felt his anger, his guilt and his remorse. This reveal reminded me he almost killed the Death Dealer, seeing and knowing this makes his character a bit more rich and complex. I appreciated that he wasn't a saint.The relationship between Shang-Chi and his father Wenwu on the surface does involve superhero theatrics, however underneath it, it does have a very relatable dynamic. As an Asian myself, I think it will hit home to most Asians and their relationship with their parents.But despite all that, I did not love the film like I wanted to. It still falls under the same old formulaic humor I despise, mainly coming from Awkwafina. I will however concede that I did expect the humor to be a lot worse and thankfully it isn't too unbearable. But if it were up to me, ""less is more."" I had some inkling that Sir Ben Kingsley would show up and he does add the redundant humor into the mix.Although it works on some level, the story mainly lumbers along, obsessed with backstory. On the one hand I did feel the drag, but in the other I felt the flashbacks did help flesh out Wenwu, Shang-Chi and his sister Xialing whom Meng'er Zhang does a good job portraying. Fala Chen also had a great supporting role as Shang-Chi's mother.While the creatures showcased in final act are pretty cool like the Great Protector, I particularly disliked Morris the faceless chicken-pig that accompanied Ben Kingsley's Trevor Slattery and found the addition very unnecessary. Speaking of unnecessary Florian Munteanu's Razor Fist was not needed. I felt all his screen time could have been devoted to the Death Dealer who I was more interested in.I also did feel like they took some tropes and traditions of Asian cinema and did not present anything unique on their own take and in doing so I got this feeling that at least half of the film did not know what it wanted to be other than an Asian American hero in the MCU.To sum it up, a stellar first half, where then Marvel eventually goes back into their comfort zone by the third act. Despite Tony Leung's magic as a performer and Simu Liu's best efforts it is ultimately another okay entry to the MCU as opposed to the top tier level films that took big swings like INFINITY WAR, the first IRON MAN, the CAPTAIN AMERICA trilogy or the first GUARDIANS. Again, being an Asian myself I wanted to love this film, but I didn't, I just thought it was okay.Two post credits scenes so stay put.7/10."
"A surpise and great watch from a marvel fan or a typical movie watcher. It really does stand out and tries to be a lot more original than the others, although expect somewhat predicable story plots along the way. It also resolves a previous issue in a marvel film which disappointed many fans, the film deserves credit for that. Great action scenes and tells a very convincing origin story which is well earnt. I'm only rating it a 7 due to the competition of all the rest of the marvel films. But be sure, this one does not disappoint."
I like Marvel try out some new characters into The Marvel universe and overall just a great movie.
This movie is action packed with the best action scenes I've seen in the MCU. The story was great and all the cast shined throughout the movie. 10/10 would watch again!
"Best and worth to watch in big screen, Satisfied the expectations,CGI is top notch, and ""NO WORDS"" to discribe the movie."
"Seamlessly combined modern martial arts fantasy and Asian mythology without cringe/dull moments made it a different kind of MCU movies to entertain international audience.Mind few (back and forth) narrative problems, Destin Daniel Cretton successfully put humor and heart in right time and places.Thanks to scintillating cast who lit up the screen especially charismatic Tony Leung.Chemistry between Simu & Awkwafina as besties are undeniably good.Action scenes including CGI works definitely made some nice highlights.Going to watch it over and over again, IMAX gave better experience for sure üòÅ"
"Crouch, you tiger! Hide, you dragon! Wax on and wax off, and fight, fight, fight!The title is as annoyingly long as the movie itself, which itself is an exercise in some ho-hum and perfunctory dotting of Is and crossing of Ts. As we wade into the shallow waters of whatever the next batch of uninspired Marvel movies present to our collective global faces, it becomes increasingly difficult to feel that old sense of joy and inspiration moviegoers used to call Movie Magic, maybe because everything is oh-so-magical all the time, a crisp and bloated 132 minutes worth.It seems almost impossible to reveal any spoilers for a movie such as this, where the plot could fit on a business card printed in a large font, something like: ""Hero shows off, struggles midway, then overcomes substantial adversity to win once again."" Will there be any sequels? Will Shang-Chi become part of the greater Marvel Cashcowiverse? Will Disney buy up other intellectual properties and make more of the same type thing?It should not feel like work when one goes to a show, and it is completely acceptable to check one's brain at the door, but these movies are becoming absolutely tedious, ponderous, even. Ponderous."
Visually it's one of the most interesting and amazing films from the MCU. But the script is really bad and poor.
"I like, and watch quite a few, 'Asian' martial arts movies. This isn't one...sort of...but the martial arts in it is really good. Some shock to say Awkwafina has a great role and she plays it so well. Even if you only slightly like the MCU, you have to see this movie. And stay through ALL of he credits."
It's better than expectations. TONY is a really good actor. It consists of many Asian elements which makes the movie more interesting.
"Very genuine film, I guess all we were waiting for a new avenger in the crew. The combats and images of this film are amazing. The main character has all the qualities to become a good element in the avengers team."
"From the first 20 minutes you can tell this was going to be a great movie and well produced.The fight scene in the bus, graphics and animation were unreal. And for the actor, felt like I was watching a new age Jackie Chan.The movie had a lot of comedy, action And story line was a little played out but still amazing.Best part is going to a movie that you hardly heard about and you're not really expecting much from the movie and it ends up being great ..Not really a spoiler but stay past the credits haha."
"The next instalment of the MCU, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it the other day and I have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young martial artist forced to face his past when his criminal father comes hunting for him.Main Character
Relative unknown Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi and he is really good in this role. He really delivers a strong performance and you will come out of the film really liking him and caring about the character of Shang-Chi. The focus on his family dynamic is really well done and Liu does a great job in selling that and showing the pain that he has been through in his life and bringing this great hero to life. He is also fantastic in the action scenes and that is a huge part of this film and you have to believe in the heroes capabilities and I really did.Supporting Characters
Awkwafina plays his best friend Katy and I feel like this character is really going to split opinion, some will hate her, some will love her. I pretty much hit both ends of the spectrum, I thought she was really annoying in the first act of the film and it hurt my enjoyment, but as she had her role slightly lessened she became much more likeable and her character arc became very clear. Tony Leung plays his first role in an American film playing Wenwu and this is one of the best antagonists in the current MCU. I loved this character and performance, he isn't just some generic bad guy and at times I really understood his motivations and saw the emotion from his performance and it was really strong. Meng'er Zhang plays Xialing and I liked her character here and I thought it really complemented Shang-Chi really well. There is clearly issues there and the film plays it up well, and makes her more then just this female sidekick and she is given a personality.Story
The story is at its strongest when it focuses on the family issues between the characters, in particular Shang-Chi and Wenwu. That father and son dynamic is great and both actors deliver really well in their roles and it makes there clashes feel even more important as you genuinely care about both of them in the film. The issue is that the film kind of strays away from that and tries to focus on too much. It has plenty of exposition scenes and fits so much in that it distracts from the main thing that makes this film great. The final act puts the focus in the wrong place, its hard to explain without spoilers but I think you will know what I mean if you watch the film.Script
The script is okay, the drama is really well done and made me care about these characters and the emotional predicaments that they are put in during this adventure and I actually think this film is held back a little bit by the fact that it is in the MCU. What I mean by that is that it has the humour you come to expect from the universe is here but it is done poorly and I never really laughed at all and that was a disappointment.Style
The film looks fantastic, the CGI is all beautiful and I think it does an excellent job of building this world of Martial arts that is very different to other elements of the MCU. The fight scenes live up to the hype and are the best that have been seen in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, the flow so well and are so hard hitting that it is easily the best element of the film.Overall
Overall, Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is a great film and another solid addition to The Marvel Cinematic Universe. It isn't top tier Marvel but does a great job of introducing a new hero in Shang-Chi."
Best CGI. And must watch Movie. With Top Notch VFX. Loved the Movie So Much.
"During watching movie i had this flavor of Jackie, after the film i found out that Brad Allan from Jackie team helped with fight scene...want to rewatch it again."
The film really went well from beginning to the end. It was really great with the visuals. The bus action sequence was great and visually was a treat to watch. Simu liu did great as shang-chi.Climax is something which you should be most awaited for. Cheers for the whole the team of shang-chi.
Loved it from the beginning til the end. This movie deserves all the hype and I was not disappointed.
"How do I start, this movie first is full of excitement, i just seen it and i was blown away, the visuals was stunning and the fight scenes?? Well i will say it was more than i expected in a very good way, i mean they were throwing down in this movie, it feel like a marvel movie not saying marvel is a bad franchise movie wise but...it has its own feel to it i do feel there is more to this movie, i will say i dont think the ten rings are the ten rings but something else, there are a lot of easter eggs in this movie from the hulk to iron man but they don't spend a lot of time going back in the past about heros, just small nods to some of the heros and certain movies, all in all this movie has strenth unlike black widow which had me falling asleep from time to time, a must go see, get the family and go see it in dolby digital at the theaters or imax, the beginning moves slow but it picks up and you're drawn in, I'm going back sunday to see it again, and i might go back the following sunday to see it as well, the movie is just that good...enjoy the watch of this movie, if you do not go...wel thats your lost."
"This was so epic on so many levels, far surpassed any expectations. The story was fantastic, visually stunning, and the fight sequences were phenomenal! My favorite Marvel movie in a LONG time. Outstanding, so excited for the rest of Phase 4."
"Story amazing, fight scenes amazing, scenery amazing, everything amazing."
"Wow was this fun. Charismatic Simu hits a home run/touchdown with this movie. Even Akwafina becomes likable by the halfway point and that's saying a lot. Unlike recent martial arts movies like Black Widow or Snake Eyes you actually see the punches and kicks. Even the wire fu looks elegant instead of ridiculous. Something very few movies have pulled off. Funny, fun and never boring despite quite a bit of exposition and the final CGI extravaganza battle is a sight to behold. Fantastic battle between the Chineese dragon and the malevolent creature. After seeing 5 disappointing back to back superhero movies:
Far from Home
Harley Quinn
WW2
Black Widow
Suicide Squad
They finally made one that's better than all those put together. Don't get me started on the utter trash that Joker was. Finally one worth seeing. Hats off to all involved."
"The movie was such a beautiful motion picture and had such amazing things to share in regards to culture. The lines outside the theatre were long and they were all different lines for different Shang Chi movie times. At first I was like wow is it really that good? But after finishing I found it to be super touching, heart wrenching at times, but still meaningful, and a marvel cinematic masterpiece. I encourage people to watch it! 1000/10 if possible!"
Felt so fresh. This is exactly the type of movie the MCU needed to keep the hype train chugging.
Best marvel movie since Thor Ragnarok. Great new addition to the MCU I love this movie and it just makes me seem so fresh and revived. The action scenes were so good the best since winter soldier and I just fell in love with this movie.
"This martial arts film was stunning. The action choreography was a visual treat, all of the cast was tremendous (Simu is a star and Tony is a legend), I loved as an Asian how it brought forth our culture without it feeling forced, and I loved the central story of family. This film deserves all of the praise it is receiving."
"ONE OF THE BEST MCU ORGINS STORIES EVER TOLD, this was SUCH A SLEEPER FILM.!"
Depicts Asian American life perfectly. Can confirm as a SF asian American native. Katy's pretty damn accurate.
"I was truly hyped for this movie just by seeing the bus clip and the trailer. I'm a huge marvel fan (not a comic reader), so I didn't know anything about Shang Chi, only heard about him. After seeing this movie, I was truly amazed. It was funny, the action sequences were very amazing, the fight choreography was awesome, reminded me of Jackie Chan. CGI was amazing.I gotta say, after seeing the movie, Shang Chi is in my top 3 favorite Marvel Charachters, and the best MCU movie for me.ITS WORTH WATCHING. Don't listen to the negative reviews. Go see it."
"Plot, action, comedy, emotion, character, relationships, theme, development, cinematography, all 10/10. Go watch!!"
"Overall a good movie. The plot falls more on the clich√© side, but is still interesting no doubt. Loved the use of culture. Also loved the fact that the main protagonists were written to have relatable personalities which allowed for more humorous moments. One thing I didn't particularly like was the use of the mythical creatures. Throughout the whole movie, Shang-Chi's father was pinned as the bad guy. Once the father was defeated, it already felt like an ending but the magical creatures appeared and it somehow turned into Shang-Chi's ultimate fight."
Typical bland crap from Marvel. Generic and paint by numbers. This movie does nothing to be special. It was boring and honestly exactly what you should expect from Marvel at this point.
"This is just like any other Marvel movie; the only difference is the majority of the cast is Chinese. Which was the same situation with Black Panther, so it isn't new.It's still an action movie, there's a lot of humor sprinkled throughout much of which comes from a ""quirky"" sidekick, it ends with a big CG battle, and there's more setup for the next thing during the end credits. It's tiresome now.The action is good, the acting is good, the story is fine, the characters are fine, the music is fine; overall, it is an entertaining movie, but the Marvel formula can only work for so long. For me, anyway."
"I wasn't sure if I was watching a childish comedy or action movie. I mean the first guardians of the galaxy had the perfect joke/serious mix in my opinion but this movie was constantly making me cringe and uncomfortable. The CGI was great but that is pretty much the only positive side of this movie in my opinion... In terms of story I was surprised there was no deeper background on where the rings actually came from, I'm not saying it needs to be in the movie but just something I missed.I noticed a lot of people enjoyed this movie when I was in the theaters, so I am happy a lot of people actually enjoyed this movie. I guess marvel is not for me anymore.This is MY opinion :)"
"**Spoilers for Shang-Chi and Iron Man 3**The Mandarin is one of Marvels most iconic vilains. He is the arch enemy of Iron Man, like Joker is the arch enemy of Batman. In Iron Man 3, they made a total joke of the Mandarin. A fine actor, Ben Kingsley, was wasted for a bad caricature of Mandarin.The Shang-Chi movie ruins the Mandarin again. Because this movie was made by left-wing liberals who preach political correctness. Because they wanted to avoid anything which might be offensive or racist. Let me ask you, what is racist about an Asian man wearing traditional Asian clothes? And what is racist about an Asian man with long hair and beard? Exactly, absolutely nothing. That's how the Mandarin looks like in the comicbooks. In this movie, he has short hair, Western everyday clothes, looking like a random regular guy (boring), totally different name. Also, in the comicbooks, each of his rings has its own power, that means ten different powers. In this movie, all rings have the same power, so not even that is done right. In conclusion, this Mandarin has nothing to do with the original.By the way, this movie ruins Shang-Chi, too. He gets god-like powers, he could defeat the mighty Thor. Why??? Shang-Chi is a tribute to Bruce Lee, he doesn't have superpowers, martial arts is his skill. Why not making great martial arts movies with Shang-Chi instead of CGI superpower blockbuster stuff?People who gave high ratings for this movie don't know the source material, so they cannot judge."
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the 2nd mcu movie returning to the cinemas all over the world and WHAT A WAY TO GET BACK IN THE GAME. As many marvel/mcu films has the good and the bad.The good: The most remarkable factor was the coreography from the action/fight sequences, very fluid and not exagerated.The soundtrack was another amazing factor, we are talking of a mixture of cultures (i really felt Black Panther vibes on this one) that can engage all the marvel and non marvel fans out there.Regards of the plot, this one was very emotional and with lot of heart and power.The cgi effects was on point (which was my biggest fear and sometimes a let down on other mcu films)The bad:
Shang chi, along side of the cast lacks of good and reliable acting which with combining with the signature forced jokes was little annoying to see.Althought the plot was simple, this was a little predictable, but overall enjoyable.Final thoughts: Despite of the forced acting, A must watch movie that definitely will engage the audience with all its assets."
"Its one of of the best movie of this year. People missed its 3D version. Nice Graphics, simple storyline, fantastic Action."
"Coming from an Asian American upbringing, I saw parts of my personal story play out on the big screen. There's something so affirming and beautiful about seeing parts of my story that I wanted people to understand now be on full display. Tony Leung specifically did a wonderful job depicting a complex father, something that we all can relate to in some shape or form. Marvel needs to invest in this franchise heavily."
"Leung's acting was superb. So good that others were pale in comparison. Simu Liu's acting lacked range, Aquafina was just being herself (though she was good during the final battle), the sister was not bad, and others were dismal at best (but the jester guy was also good).Great action sequences, Leung's storyline was good but simplified, Shang-Chi lacked real struggles (he didnt seem bothered by the abandonment of his sister, his ability to fight improved in one day, he sat on the dragon for a good 15min without doing anything, ... the list goes on), the soundtrack was not that great, the portrayal of simple colorful villagers were ... hm...Solid action, Leung was the highlight, meh about other stuff."
"It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing). That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I'd be very surprised if she didn't, in future projects). He's joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I'm told she's in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.Not quite, yet almost ""Black Panther for Asian audiences"", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I've already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that. Ultimately, it is presented through a Western lens, and clearly we need to go further in this direction, still, it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster, which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture, especially one focusing on a group they don't belong to), to the point where countless times, when it makes sense, major characters in this speak Mandarin to each other, rather than English, which it is subtitled into. And ""don't worry"", for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen, and they aren't made out to be ""less than"".The action(each sequence of which feels distinct, belongs with the rest, and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films, acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jackie Chan, wuxia, etc. The choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography. Not only are we seeing incredible fighting, the camera is dynamic, celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is. That *is* why you hire Bill Pope, the director of photography on the Matrix trilogy, two of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man entries, Darkman and Team America. The special effects are excellent. There are some issues with pacing, and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks.This features relatively brief but highly concentrated, surprisingly graphic gore(you know, there was a time when the fact that it's happening to beings that clearly are not human, wasn't enough to get away with this kind of thing with a PG-13 rating. Pepperidge Farm remembers), as well as a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations, and people passionate about diversity hiring. 8/10."
"What an Amazing Movie......
REALLY A VISUAL TREAT FOR THE AUDIENCE.Shang-chi deserves The Best Solo Hero Movie Of 2021.Visual effects are the best
Super powers of Shang chi are really good.Dont miss the 2 Post credit scenes
MARVEL FOREVER."
"This is the best marvel film i have seen besides Endgame, it bring a whole new feeling to the MCU and it pays off tenfold. Not much else to say."
Didn't know about the movie and was skeptical but ill tell you u won't regret it. Best movie out of covid times.
The CGi and story telling was out of this world. Character development too! The ones who gave it a bad rating clearly has 0 taste and probably did not watch the movie. This movie made people into shang chi fans! Marvel stepped up! And I am happy!!!!
"POSITIVE
-great Casting (SImu Liu, Tony Lueng). Especially Tony Lueng because he look badass and has great acting skill.-You've already heard people praising the film's action choreography, and it's well-deserved. It doesn't has many cut scenes like many MCU fighting scenes.-This film felt completely unique from what we've seen from the MCU already.-Props to the beautiful cinematography and soundtrack as well, they were great!-The first two act was incredible and amazing showing the life of Shang-Chi, how Wenwu meet his wife etc. This type of act is something MCU usually doesn't have.-This film open up MCU to new world with myth creature, many evil organization, and the mystery of the Ten Rings.NEGATIVE
-The casting was STELLAR. Aside from the one person I didn't care for (*Razor Fist, cough cough*) everybody played their roles to perfection.-The jokes may not be funny to some people. But It's funny to me.-The only issue I had with Shang-Chi was the third act. Not that it was bad, but it felt detracting from what the first 2/3rds of the movie established. It become every MCU logic part(CGI BATTLE). It took away from the great hand-to-hand action stunt work, but it's to be expected from a film of this genre.The exposition can be a bit heavy but understandably needed to introduce a brand newcharacter into this universe.IMO
Great way to introduce new hero. Great Martial art fight scenes. Great characters. Looking forward to Shang-Chi. Also Wenwu.Not a Top Tier Film in Movie Industry but A Top Tier Film in MCU STANDALONE movies."
"Really awesome fights. Some of the best in the MCU! The fact that Shang has a poster in his room, from the movie The Warriors is amazing. I had a really fun time! It was funny and heartfelt. Crossed the line into cheesy a time or two."
10/10 the fighting is absolutely magnificent like we are watching a Jackie chan movie.
"Shang-Chi was a joy from start to finish. Simu Liu and Awkwafina balance the comedy and drama of the script masterfully. The movie felt grounded, which is refreshing in comparison to the spectacle of other movies released by Marvel Studios.The choreography is top notch! This film has some of the best hand-to-hand combat sequences that I've seen in years and the cinematography only compliments that.The real heart of this movie comes from Tony Leung Chiu-wai. He stole the scene whenever he was on camera and had me deciding in my head if his character was evil or not, which is a quality that only enhances the ""villain"" role in any comic book movie.Lastly, the soundtrack by 88rising was beautifully curated and I hope will pave the way for more diverse album soundtracks."
This movie has made me realise how useful history is. This movie will be remembered more then WW2. This is so amazing. I want to marry this movie.
"I think the movie was very great it's the way how the comic book was in
Good performance to bring the character to live action.I read the comic book I noticed story I think it was a good story and a good movie."
"I don't what to say it is just too good, filled with different types of martial arts and fantasy, with a hilarious Katy."
This movie have a different and best action of all marvel movies.
"Finally a Good Marvel movie. Was sick of nonsensical movies by Marvel and DC since long with dad jokes type of dialogues and no concrete storyline or material like Avatar. But I liked this one. Maybe Hollywood should make an Indian Avatar based movie, that would be exciting like some old Indian Gods mythology type of movie. As Bollywood really sux when it comes to making such movies, they're only good at making good biopics."
Everything about this movie was amazing!! If you haven't watched. Watch. Now. My only problem is that they didn't really use that many characters that were hyped up. Such as the death dealer and the abomination.
"The Marvel machine continues to turn out grand entertainments with remarkable regularity. SHANG-CHI is no exception. This film mixes light drama, comedy, and action in an entertaining brew. The visual effects and art direction impress. Though the action scenes are exciting, the presence of Michelle Yeoh occasionally reminds of films where thrilling stunts and martial arts were performed without the aid of visual effects."
"'Black Widow' may have been the first Marvel Cinematic Universe film to hit theaters following the recommencement of major films debuting in theaters after the COVID 19 pandemic numbers dropped, however, 'Shang-Chi' is the true start of the next wave of MCU development. All of the original characters, minus Thor, have been retired from service by death or other means so new blood is required via new superheroes and new origin stories, and given the current state of affairs look for a much more diverse flavor of super-hero going forward. 'Shang-Chi' marks the first step on that path with the first true Asian super-hero to hit the big screen starring Simu Liu in the title role who is originally from China although his parents immigrated to Canada when he was only five. The actors and characters here are almost entirely Asian lending credibility to the character and the plot. Co-stars include Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung.Thousands of years ago Xu Wenwu discovers these ten magical rings which he can wear to give him great power and immortality. He wields them through the centuries to collect power. In 1996 he journeys to the hidden entrance of a village known as Ta Lo to accumulate more power. He meets a woman, Ying Li, guarding the entrance and she is able to match him in a martial arts fight. He leaves but returns and eventually love sprouts between the two. For a time he sets aside the rings and power and starts a family resulting in two children but when Ying Li dies he reverts to his old ways and raises his kids under his authoritarian rule within his Ten Rings criminal organization. He raises son Shang-Chi to be a warrior, but Shang flees, leaving his sister, and starts a new life in San Francisco. There he exists as a normal guy with job as a car valet. He is kind of an underperforming slacker, but seems happy with where he is. His best friend is Katy played by Awkwafina. One day Shang-Chi is attacked on a bus and his medallion is stolen and he knows his father has found him. This launches him and Katy on a quest to find his sister and foil his father's nefarious plans before he destroys the mythical town where his mother is from by unleashing some kind of hellspawn demon into the world.While 'Shang-Chi' is raking in rave reviews my response is a bit more measured. I think this is a solid origin story and introduces a dynamic new character that could prove to be a vital part of this next phase of the MCU. I think Simu Liu is well cast as is Awkwafina as his best friend/sidekick, but I thought overall the film was better than average rather than the superlative, next level action hero blockbuster I was expecting. First I feel that the film is derivative in its plot a bit. Some of this comes from the fact that I just saw 'Raya and the Last Dragon' and this feels a lot like that movie. They both even feature Awkwafina and 'Shang-Chi' even has a dragon in final climactic battle sequence. I thought it was clever, but also clearly revisionist history to have Ben Kingsley's much maligned Trevor (aka The Mandarin), from 'Iron Man 3' make an appearance. That was clearly designed to undo the plot misstep that was utilizing The Mandarin and the Ten Rings in that film as a sham terrorist organization. I very much enjoyed all the martial arts action and the fights were very well filmed and choreographed. The actual ten rings of power that eventually get passed to Shang-Chi by the end felt like a bit of one trick pony. They were kind of cool and clearly powerful, but the artifact's power set remained a bit unclear and their use while visually stimulating seemed very cartoonish at times. I am not sure how to rectify the look of the ten rings when employed, but I was hoping for better on that front. I was also perplexed a bit by the clear takeover of the Ten Rings organization by Shang's sister at the film's close which seems designed to lead to a larger plot in a different film, but that move also is very reminiscent of what Sharon Carter is doing over in the Disney Plus MCU shows.Most of the time I found myself asking the larger MCU questions rather than enjoying this film. This came in the form of the appearance of Wong and Emil Blonsky (aka Abomination) in an underground fighting ring in Macau run by Shang-Chi's sister. Why are this two disparate MCU supporting characters there and also why do they appear to be in allegiance as one is a hero and the other a villain? The other MCU connections come in the post credit scenes where Wong pulls hastily minted super-heroes, and possibly new Avengers, Shang and Katy, into his Sanctum Santorum for a powwow with Captain Marvel and Bruce Banner regarding the ten rings artifact which are emitting a mysterious signal. The most important piece of all this would seem to be the glaring absence of Doctor Strange.There is a lot of good stuff to take away from 'Shang-Chi'. The film is full of some new and dynamic characters. Marvel needs these characters to catch fire if they are going to build this next phase of the MCU into something that can culminate in an 'Infinity War/Endgame' level event. This is a good story, even if a tad derivative, and it is filmed and executed well. It has some prototypical MCU style humor, mainly due to Awkwafina, but the humor is more low key than a lot of other MCU films. The well choreographed fight scenes are about the best thing here. They are fun and intense and really take me back to boyhood trying to absorb as many martial arts movies as I could. This is a solid entry, especially as an origin story, into the MCU. I liked the film and the character of Shang-Chi. It remains to be seen how he will be integrated, going forward, into the larger cinematic universe.Eric's Grade: B."
"Right from the start I realised that the plot structure and storyline was very standard and repetitive. It's seen in many other action/superhero films. But as the action kicked in, I was still invested. It's a very fast paced movie with some new action sequences we haven't seen in the mcu yet, as well as some good comedic moments. The choreography for the action is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Very long cuts show all the action without quick cuts after every move someone takes. It's also a very beautiful film I thought in terms of scenery and colours. Music was also great, epic score and some killer songs. Definitely check out the soundtrack. But as the film entered its long third act, the ending was very underwhelming. We are being thrown at with so much stuff in a short period of time, so the reveals of some things and actions aren't as interesting as they should of been. But the film has opened up even more possibilities for what's to come in the mcu timeline, so make sure to stay for those credits scenes. But even someone who hasn't seen any or a few mcu films can watch this as it's a good standalone film. They may not understand a few things that characters talk about regarding previous events but I could assume that they'd still be invested. Overall, a solid entry for our new character Shang-Chi in the mcu, as well as having some awesome action, funny moments and eye popping miss en scene."
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now. While the movie follows the usual stereotypes, it manages to stand out with its stunning special effects and locations.The movie revolves around Shaun, a Chinese immigrant living in the United States of America who is working as a valet with his quirky friend and soulmate Katy. One day, they get attacked by a group of assassins on a bus and only just manage to survive. Shaun immediately understands that the attack must be related to his influential estranged father. Along with Katy, he decides to team up with his tough estranged sister Xialing to find out what's going on.This film convinces on multiple levels. First of all, the acting performances are quite quirky and convincing. Especially the ladies steal the show. Awkwafina delivers the goods as curious, dynamic and funny woman that anyone would like to have as a friend. Zhang Meng'er on the other side represents a much darker character shaped by dramatic events from the past who is much more difficult to approach with her tough, relentless and independent personality.The expensive special effects certainly deliver the goods as well. The scenes in a fantasy world, in Ancient China and in contemporary San Francisco are all equally stunning to watch. The fantastic creatures such as dragons look impressive on the big screen.The story might be predictable but is nevertheless entertaining from start to finish thanks to steady pace and inspired execution. You will truly care about the fates of the different characters as you are watching this film.However, this film isn't without its occasional flaws. First of all, lead actor Simu Liu simply doesn't have the charisma of the other actresses and actors involved. Casting him was a bold choice but it didn't fully pay off in my opinion.Up next, the movie desperately tries to connect to other characters in the Marvel Universe. The appearance of Trevor Slattery played by Ben Kingsley is completely random as it only seems to be a pretext to offer some misplaced comic relief. The mid-credit scene starts in an amusing fashion but suddenly involving Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers only seems like a weak attempt to develop a hype for potential sequels. The same goes for yet another scene after the credits that evokes more questions rather than concluding the film appropriately.At the end of the day, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining fantasy action film of the Marvel Universe that should appeal to faithful and occasional fans alike. It's one of the better films in the franchise but perhaps Marvel should focus on quality over quantity instead of becoming a monstrous capitalistic machine that is scarier than any gigantic dragon shown in the film."
"This movie was great, it was entertaining, it was fast paced, and it was unique. There were so many things I liked about this film. First off, I loved all the characters, such as Shang-Chi, Katy, Xu Wenwu, Xialing, Razor Fist, Death Dealer, the return of Trevor Slattery, Morris, and of course Master Guang Bo. The actors for all these characters were also perfect. They suited their roles perfectly. In my opinion, this movie had some of the best supporting characters in the MCU. I also loved the action. It was absolutely amazing, there were some points in the movie where I felt like I was watching a martial arts movie. The stunts and the choreography were perfect, I couldn't have asked for anything more. The effects in this movie were also stunning. The moving forest, the mythical creatures (especially the dragon), and the effects used on the Ten Rings were super cool. The effects in this movie were some of the best in the MCU. Lastly, I also loved the plot, it just sat really well with me.This movie was like nothing we have ever seen before in the MCU. It was very unique and a nice twist for Marvel. The first Credit Scene was also very interesting and might have set up phase 4 in the MCU. This was a great movie, and I definitely recommend going to see it, even if you aren't a Marvel fan."
"This movie was all around amazing. The visuals were amazing, it was a very heartfelt story and Simu Liu's and Tony Leung's performances were truly extraordinary.I didn't give it 10 stars because the final battle felt a little underwhelming in comparison to the rest of the movie (something I have noticed is a common theme in Marvel movies).Would honestly give it a 9.5."
"This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame. Finding new stories to tell within cultures rarely explored is the way for the MCU to continue to entertain.The fights in the first third of this movie were absolutely brutal and quite innovative. I wish they hadn't front-loaded all of this stunning choreography since the fights later on paled in comparison. This film also contains arguably the most beautiful and artful scene in the MCU with the Crouching Tiger-inspired hidden garden duel. There was a sense of more indie-based filmmaking and I really enjoyed that fresh take on the genre. I would be remiss not to mention Tony Leung, who perfectly brings to life one of the finest villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and is one you can truly empathize with.While there are still the tropes expected in a Marvel origin film, it succeeds pretty well for the most part. I wish the big CGI battle at the end had just been a personal fight between father and son, but alas. The humor, especially Awkwafina, was pretty hit or miss as well. The Trevor Slattery stuff was great though.Shang-Chi is definitely one of the best origin films in the MCU and really stands out as a unique entry in the long-running series."
Shang Chi is a breath of fresh air. Shang Chi truly shows us the beauty of Martial Arts. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.
"POSITIVES:1) The villain is one of the strongest of the MCU in my opinion. Shang's relationship with his father is very complex and multi dimensional and I was very engaged by him as a villain - threatening but relatable
2) The first half of the film is fantastic - everything up until Shang is reunited with his father. The hand to hand combat scenes in this first half of the film are excellent and I was very engaged by the story during this period as well
3) The cinematography and direction were very good, there was definitely a certain sense of style to the way the film was shot. The hand to hand combat scenes for example are often shot with long takes and a swirling camera and it was a very high quality of camerawork in my opinionNEGATIVES:1) As is typical with Marvel, there is lots of attempted humour and there is lots of it that doesn't work
2) The idea that Katy has never picked up a bow and arrow in her life but then goes on to save the day with it was just outrageous and took me out of the film. They clearly felt like they had to give her something to do but it was a bad decision to do that
3) The film severely falls away in the second act in my opinion. It goes from a relatively grounded film about family, where all the fight scenes are hand to hand, to a film about a giant soul eating dragon that is going to destroy the entire universe. The second half of the film is what made me have to lower my grade because I was sitting at a 9 after the end of the first half."
First of all I have to say that the action sequences of this movie were great and it's cinematography was on point. The REAL Mandarin aka shang chi's father is easily the best marvel villain for me. Plus it was refreshing to see the ten rings in action. The story was good but I wish there were some changes in the script to make the movie more interesting as it got a bit slow in the second half. The climax was a bit dramatic. There were some moments which could have been better if the script was right. In the end as a marvel fan it's a great film but as a Superhero fan who isn't really into particular studio can find this movie an okayish one.
"The first 2 acts were funny and action packed and they had good villain,so what's the problem the problem is I didn't know I was watching marvel movie till Wong was in it, and the 3rd act with all the dragon stuff and the father turning good nice redemption arc but then they threw away good villain so he could fight a cgi monster wich by the way why couldn't his aunt defeat him if she knew the moves why did she teach shung chi,it wasn't a satisfying ending and there wasn't a threat and all that crazy fighting for what all that soulsucker needed was arrow to throat (it's cool he's first Asian superhero on screen but doesn't mean this was great marvel movie)but if was own movie I probably would have rated this higher it's not Thor the dark world bad but it's between captain marvel and antman overall ok."
"This movie is by no mean nothing more special than a standard marvel movie. But where this story flawed the acting, villain, comedy and visual was amazing. Loved this movie and felt like something new, something fresh."
This is definitely the best Marvel movie I've seen in a while and probably the most un-Marvel feeling one too. The fight seems are incredible - the bus fight being the stand out. Fantastic choreography and heavily influenced by old martial arts movies. The CGI throughout is amazing too as you'd expect from Marvel. I felt the amount of comedy was just right with Ben Kingsley smashing it again as Trevor - superb. As others have commented there are some pacing issues in the second half but overall it's a fun ride so enjoy! The first end credits scene is worth holding on for but don't bother with the second!
"By far my favourite Marvel Movie of all time. Great story, great actors, great visuals and overall a great experience.I just wish I had the ability to forget it all, only so I could watch it again not knowing the what will happen next."
"Plus:
Tony Leung perfomance
Action sequences
Climax portion
Chinese representation
Emotional weightMinus:
Dull and routine start of first half
Less intriguing scenes
Hero portion not much elevated
No proper backstory for 10 ringsVerdict:A decent watch for audience and visual treat for fans....."
This movie has it all nostalgia(Shaolin) + Ninjas+ Very good Graphics+ Comedy+ Action.
At first I thought this was gonna be a okay ish movie but it's not it's actually a good movie and the story is good the action is great and awkwafina is the best... It's fun to actually see a new and more powerful hero in the universe and who is funny like seriously he's funny and the action choreography is great because those punches damn those were some real punches and kicks... This Movie is great and it's marvel so no doubt there go watch it!...
"As it's quite clear that marvel has a standard formula of making origin stories which is exactly what it has done in Shang Chi. The story doesn't have much to offer but the action sequences, vfx and the performances of all the actors make it an exciting watch. Another best thing is the new world it introduces, just like how they did in Black Panther.P. S. - one extra rating for the post credit sequence üôä"
"It's a really good superhero movie, marvel doesn't disappoint. As always.A little deus ex machina at the end spoiled it a bit for me but it's not a big deal."
"The 3rd cinema visit this year (2021) for me brought a delightful marvel film.I REALLY enjoyed this film. It has it all: inspired martial arts, humor , character developments, emotions, and its also quite spectacular, even if we may thinnk we've ""seen it all already"" with so much visual effects heavy movies coming out over these past ten years or so.It makes you marvel (pun intended) and laugh,
It has a heart of goodness.I can VERY MUCH recommend seing this movie in a cinema."
"This movie is worth watching, marvel has a funny way of connecting the storylines of other MCU films. The fight choreography and CGI is above standards and the story line is superb! Amazing film."
"This movie was amazing. One of Marvel's best. I love when Marvel makes an action packed movie, yet contains an important message about family and overcoming grief. I'm not sure if this is the best for children, as the ending, and the incessant sight of death may be a little much for young fans. Additionally, the editing and cinematography are by far the best I've ever seen in a marvel film."
"Tony leung carried the entire show, I hope everyone outside of Asia and who are not Chinese hope they know how lucky Hollywood was to have him in a Hollywood film. You can compare the lack of charisma from simu lu when you have them together in scenes. Even awkwafina did a better job than simu, but good job for them finally creating a decent movie for asians representation!"
"I'm a marvel huge fan and unfortunately I could not watch black widow in theaters so right after it came out I went to watch Shang-Chi. What can I say, I got out from the cinema very excited at first but still kind of disappointed- it looks like a disney live action more than a marvel movie... I have nothing to say about the special effects and combat scenes though, those were amazing.Anyways, I can't say I wasted my money because it's still a nice movie, but I know that some people might not like it because it doesn't even seem to be a marvel movie."
"There is an instant thrill in having a supersized Marvel superhero movie begin with a voiceover in Mandarin as Tony Leung comes into the frame. One of the world's great actors, Leung exerts an effortless majesty. In Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, he plays Wenwu - an immortal who possesses 10 rings with enormous occult power. Wenwu, also known as The Mandarin, heads a criminal organisation called The Ten Rings, which was introduced in the first Iron Man movie. He is a man tormented by an insatiable lust for power, which somehow gets submerged under his love for his wife but then resurfaces after her death as something even more twisted and vicious. Wenwu is one of the more tragic villains in the MCU and Leung plays him with a melancholic charisma that doesn't let up even in the climax as several CGI creatures twist and snarl and prey on everything in their path. He is one of the many pleasures of this film.Read the full review on Film Companion."
Honestly its good movie. But it is not the best one . I expected much but it not full fill my expectations. There is not any twists. One time watchable movie thats all.
"I really wanna do the Michael Pena summary, but here's a MUCH shorter version:So its like a Joy of Luck Club mini reunion, but then there's this parkour on crack session... but then they ride Mr Weasley's enchanted car to this Chinese Wakanda, and then ride Mulan's Mushu to fight the Chinese Kraken and save the world... and basically Awkwafina and Wong steal the show! Welcome to the hotel Californiaaasa!"
"Great action fantasy adventure with a compelling story arc. The storyline is great, a compelling villain, and an amazing marvel origin story. Great comedic timing, great cinematography, and amazing fight sequences. The music in this was perfect for the movie and the character arc. A satisfying and awesome climax. A great action film to watch."
Best mcu movie ever best fight scene.!!A different style of mcu movie.
"I went in with a moderate expectation thinking this movie would be the typical predictable DIsney film. But I was wrong and blown away both by the complex story line AND the FREAKING AWESOME choreography martial arts. The film is exciting from the beginning, the acting and the chemistry between characters are captivating, especially between Shang Chi and Katy. The cinematography is flawless. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. 10/10."
"I love this movie!! A great mixture of flying kung fu movies and MCU cinematic movies. I recommend it to all, please stay for the end credits (if you didn't know this already)."
This movie is a must see of 2021. It's has a great story and I am willing to see it again. Words can't describe how good it was.
"If Mario Puzo or Truman Capote were to write a fantasy it would feel like this. Or if Lewis Carroll were to write a crime drama it would feel like this. ""Shang Chi"" is, in essence, this sort of fascinating, singularly unique and audacious combination wrapped up in a wildly entertaining martial arts film. ""Shang Chi"" feels like no other MCU production because of this interplay of seemingly dissimilar elements. But, where else could one possibly come across such an engrossing mix than in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where a raccoon once sent e-mails to a Russian assassin? That's the beauty of ""Shang Chi;"" it propels quite enthusiastically and energetically into this vast inexplicable new terrain which only Stan Lee and his fellow artists and creators could have envisioned or foretold. An extraordinary offering from Marvel Studios, ""Shang Chi"" is a must-see!"
"I am not interested in popcorn movies at all. However, when I knew that Tony Leung is one of the main cast. I gave my last chance to Marvel.The fight scenes mix with styles from Ip Man, Kung-Fu...., this movie reached 80% of the standard. Especially for the fight between Wen-Wu and his wife.(Which is shown in the trailer)Also the plot is better than normal MCU movies. At least there is a all-round character description for Shang-Chi and other role players. Fair performance from every actor. However, Tony Leung(Wen-Hu) shown why he is the best actor of Cannes. Every move, eye-contact, voice is well-designed. He creates WenWu himself. (It has to give credit to the director also) He shown the reason why WenWu did those bad things.After all, Shang-Chi is a superhero movie. Description would not be detailed as the movie which Tony Leung casted normally. However, as one of the Tony's fan. It is a breakthrough for him. He seemed enjoyed from the interviews. Hope can see the background of WenWu in another movie."
"I actually enjoy the movie I didn't hate it or love it, it has a few to many slow parts for my personal like I was extremely hype to see it got there started off amazingly got to the beginning of the middle and the middle of the middle of the movie it was just to many dry/slow parts at that point for me lucky that's when they hit with the dragon eyes and the Mandarin saves at that point for me just enough to give me a little more energy to stay up I was dozing off lmao I actually love the layers of his father to me it seemed more of his story then his story and how the lost of his wife actually is the reason why he did what he did and to show no matter how much you battle you conquer destroy take over Love is All powerful and even the most powerful individuals are weak when it comes to love and can be easily manipulated when it comes to love I dislike the father at first until you see his reason behind it then you actually hurt for him because he wants his wife so bad to the point some things he refused to see because he wants his with that bad, and it actually outshine his son backstory the ending of the movie most definitely save the movie to me because it was action but not enough action to me it should have been a lot more action the movie seem to be slightly rush in some area the end credits mmm to be blunt the first end credit should have been last and the last end credit should have been first I love the empowerment of women it should have been done better they touched on their culture very well with the daughter and sons one not look at the same as the other and I love how they made effort to touch on the Urban culture as well with the music buuuuut a lil overkill for the most part I give it a 7 because it just takes you out around the middle a little to much the slow/dry parts was to much not enough action and I wouldn't pay my money again to go back and look at it again but I will buy it, when it comes out in 4k but only if it's on sale I couldn't get in to it like I wanted to I would say go out and see it very amazing movie."
Totally different from usual super hero movies.Just great and awesome.
"For The whole film I was glued to the big screen, a unique origin story which at its heart people might say it's a generic hero backstory with a predictive rise to power, but that's exactly why we love these films! Amazing fight scenes and the visuals throughout were beautiful. It's exciting to see the introduction of other much more different universe in the MCU. Overall this film is beautifully made and an absolute joy to watch, with a great soundtrack too."
"Great action, great sci-fi, great scenario
Another wonderful movie just has been added to the MCU."
Very good movie and one of the amazing marvel series keep going üí™üèºüí™üèºüòç
"Very enjoyable! Visuals and action sequences were amazing, storytelling was well done."
I think this movie was so enjoyable and funny. A lot better than Black Widow. The fight scenes are all perfect and visuals too. Acting was perfect by Shang-Chi' actor and Wong.
Dragons are real. Just see this movie. Dragons. Are. Real.
"The journey of a self doubting and traumatized person into confident saviour of the world. Now add in some loyal characters who always believe in the protagonist's ability and some humour, now you have Marvel's good old formula for Solo origin movies.Marvel has perfected this formula and it works. It is fun to watch Simu Liu's Shang-Chi growing into the worthy hero to possess legendary ten rings. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's Wen wu easily dominates the screen presence and leaves lasting impression on the viewers. Ageless Michelle yeoh does her part very well and Awkwafina is....there.Besides the Captain America and the winter soldier, this movie has some of the best hand to hand combat scenes in the whole MCU. The Mid credits scene was a surprise and Marvel fans, Don't miss it.While the movie is not boring, it doesn't take risks and doesn't venture into unique and bold story telling like GOTG, Infinity war and Endgame. If you have watched both trailers for this movie, you pretty much know what's gonna happen after spending 15 mins into the movie.Overall, Shang-Chi is a worthy addition to the MCU (Or should I say MCM üòâ? ) and a decent movie to visit theatres after two long years."
"In short, you will enjoy it. In long, well you should go and see it yourself as there are a lot to talk about :) I first thought the dragon might make me not like the movie. I was wrong! I am usually not a fan of dragon but I liked this one (or I can say didn't hate it). I hope you have fun too :)"
"I didn't know what to expect going in, superhero? Martial arts? And to me it ended up being more fantasy/supernatural than superhero. That being said, I liked it and I was entertained, it had a strange 80's vibe to me and I had feelings at times like I have seen this before...probably just me. The story was good, acting was good, visuals were spectacular, the middle did kinda drag a little, but overall it was a good movie.If you're looking for a martial arts movie, it's not Enter the Dragon and it's certainly not superhero like Spider-man or Superman. It's different, fresh, and I can see why many will love it. You could hate superheroes in general and still love this movie, so it would be a shame for people to avoid this movie because they don't like Superhero movies. I say give it a shot, but don't expect anything like Enter the Dragon or Superman, you will be disappointed."
As someone who loves martial arts movies I think that Shang-Chi was a beautiful homage to the classics while also introducing a newer take with its ties to Marvel as well as including modern Asian American experiences. Personally it is one of my top Marvel movies!
One of the best origin films in the MCU. And one of the best Marvel films overall. 10/10 recommend.
"The ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Wakanda"" layering on of endless flashbacks and ""ancient legends"" gets a bit thick (and sags noticeably in the back half), but overall this addition of an Asian superhero story hits all the right notes, powered mainly by 2 early bravura action sequences (scaffolding on the side of a high rise mirror glass tower is especially well rendered). The performances are solid, if not exactly groundbreaking (Michelle Teoh especially has little new to do), and the direction is serviceable. But the whole thing ends in yet another CGI heavy big bass fight that is just... well, way too predictable. Snazzy post credit sequence teases Dr Strange but also adds more mystery to the 10 Rimgs... which is becoming Marvel's staple out: always teasing better content next time. Even that's wearing a bit thin."
"Typical cheesiness of every Marvel movie. I enjoy Marvel movies, but already know to go into them open to a certain degree of unseriousness and just enjoy them for what they are. That being sad, I thought Shang Chi was actually one of the stronger Marvel movies I've seen. It did become cheesy with the dragons, but the fight scenes were top notch. The acting was strong and Awkwafina was hilarious. Overall, a solid movie. Not the best, but stronger than most."
"I did not have high expectations for this movie. Like many, I wasn't familiar with this hero going in.That being said, the choreography in action scenes was PHENOMENAL. Definitely the highlight of the film for me.If you're a fan of film, you will enjoy this beautiful movie."
My boyfriend and I saw Shang-Chi during the in the late afternoon (3pm to be exact) so we missed all the rush. Anyways this movie is really the best since I saw endgame back in 2019. The story is great and the special effect/cgi is amazing. It is a bit hard to follow at times since there's so much going on in the scene. I highly recommend this movie for any marvel fans out there!
"Epic fight scenes without too much visually clutter like most marvel movies great actors funny moments impressive characters and backstoriesAnd the best part,Wong."
"Amazing choreography, incredible acting by the core cast. One of the few movies where you see so much heart in the main ""villain"" . Can't recommend this enough."
"Shang Chi and the legend of the ten rings
2021
12A
director: Destin Daniel Cretton
starring: Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Ben Kingsley, Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Michelle Yeoh, Wah Yeun, Florian Munteanu etcShang Chi (Simu Liu) the master of unarmed weaponry-based kung fu. Is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the ten rings organisation. Wow what a film Shang Chi was and one of the strongest additions to the MCU.My first few positives would be the character background and set up. As well as the fantastic cinematography, worldbuilding and action. As well as the likeable characters and performances. I really liked that the film went into the character background for the Mandarin and the mythology of the ten rings and how he got them, with an action packed and well explained opening sequence that set the tone for the film very well, offering something different from the MCU from the very first scene. I also thought the set up was strong, the film established Shang Chi and his life without his dad excellently, making you connect to the characters, but also did a great job at setting up the villain's intentions well and developing the plot nicely. The cinematography in this film had to be some of the most beautiful visuals I have seen from the MCU. There were so many beautifully shot scenes especially within the action scenes with mid or long shots where you could actually see what was happening. The colour grading and scope of the film was seriously impressive, I was in awe. I also thought the action was probably the strongest I have seen from the MCU. The action was incredibly choreographed, very entertaining, and incorporated Asian culture and kung fu and they were so well shot it was one of the films strongest elements. The worldbuilding was also very strong. This film introduced us to such a rich and beautiful new world, it was beautiful and well explained and really explored in a lot of detail but left more to be explored for the future. This film was like seeing Wakanda for the first time. The film had such likeable characters. Particularly with Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) all of the new characters introduced were instantly likeable and I connected with them quickly. This was also helped by the fantastic Chemistry between the whole cast, everyone worked amazing together, especially Simu Liu and Awkwafina who were both amazing here, and did amazing performances. They both had loads of charm and charisma. Other cast standouts were Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh and Menger Zhang.My next few positives would be the humour and sound design. The family dynamic and character depth. As well as the fun cameos and Plot twists. The soundtrack for the film was also excellent, it gave the action scenes in particular an intense atmosphere and really elevated a lot of the scenes well. I really liked the family dynamic the film had. Having the villain be Shang Chi's father and his mother and sister be involved was a great idea. It made the film more personal to the characters and increased the stakes for the characters, they had a connection and the conflict between the different members of the family was very well written. This gave characters like Shang Chi and the Mandarin a lot more character depth. The mandarin was so crushed by his wife's death because she made him a good man, and his quest to find his wife really gave him some emotional depth, and Shang Chi's attempt to live a normal life and escape his father's shadow, but also look for his dads love and acceptance was really well handled, as well as his character decisions involving his sister and his regret over his mother gave his character a good amount of layers. The cameos in this film were a lot of fun, there was a few easter eggs sprinkled throughout but it still felt like its own film. But having Wong back was a great surprise and that was in the trailer so not a spoiler. I also thought the plot twists were strong. The twists involving the family's secrets and the new world were well executed, unexpected and added some great layers to the film, it never once got boring.I did have a few minor issues. The villain was underused going into the final act, there was a few issues with the creative decisions in the final act. And there was a slight overusage of flashbacks. I did find that the mandarin was taken out of a big chunk of the film in order to delay the final act and expand the story world more, it would have been nice for his character to be incorporated within the plot as a whole instead of being used for more flashbacks. I did find that there were too many flashbacks. A lot of them served the plot well and had purpose, but some of them felt unneeded and repetitive and were occasionally jarring. There were just a few creative decisions in the final act I wasn't fond of. There was some overusage of CGI that took me out of a couple of scenes, and there was a deux ex Machina with Katy that was slightly cheesy to me.My final few positives would be the set pieces. Great development to the plot and balance to the villain. As well as interesting elements, great dialogue, and a great final act. The films set locations were beautiful, they really captured the magic of the world as well as Asian culture, the representation for the Asian community in this film was excellent. The plot development was also excellent, the twists gave the film multiple layers to work with, and the different acts flowed well, with constant new elements being added to keep the film feeling fresh. I also thought the film did an excellent job at making the audience sympathise with the Mandarin but also making it clear he was still the villain, as the film showed what kind of man he used to be with his wife I understood him wanting to be reunited with her, but the film excellently balanced this with his cruel and controlling behaviour to make him one of the strongest villains I have seen in a while in the MCU. I also thought there was a lot of interesting elements to the story world. The world of Ta lo was fascinating, and the film went into great detail of the culture and the lives of the people living there which was fascinating. The dialogue was also great, raising great themes of acceptance, family and grief that was excellently told through the lines of dialogue that felt personal to the characters and were very well written. The final act was also amazing. They went all out with the visuals and action. In a thrilling, exciting and breath-taking final act that conclude the story and the character arcs excellently and setting up Chang Chi's future in the MCU very well.Overall, Shang Chi has a few structure issues and falls into some MCU tropes with the CGI in the final act. But this film was visually stunning, with some of the best worldbuilding and action from the MCU. With star making performances from Simu Liu and Awkwafina. Also, with amazing Asian representation. This has really taken the MCU in a different direction and is one of their strongest origin stories.Overall rating 92/100."
"Shang Chi is a visual treat.. It has great acting, great visual effects but it lacks on screenplay in the 2nd half.. The 1st half was so good, I was enjoying the movie very very much with great martial arts and comic timing from Awkwafina.. The bus fight scene was just amazing!!! So good!! After the 1st half is done.. the movie went downhill.. It could have been better but still it was decent.. Anyways Shang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings serves the purpose of entertainment and we can say that Marvel Studios never disappoint us with their movies..7.7/10 ‚≠ê"
"I like it, its a chinese fighting kung fu more in the MCU. They really dealve deep into the back story and gave the characters life."
"The movie was entertaining to some degree and followed the standard Marvel Universe formula. Trite, current day pop cultural references and jokes during the first half of the movie were cheap and certainly will be lost on audiences of the future. A few idiots in the theatre guffawed loudly at most of them. As usual, though, the women were strong, kind and intelligent and the men were dumb and evil. Are we to believe that the most evil man in the Universe, Xi, is going to change his evil ways and that his wife would have even married a mass murderer on the scale of Genghis Kahn or Vlad the Impaler? Of course she's killed by his enemies and he returns to a life of evil and sends his henchmen to kill his own children to retrieve some necklaces so he can read a map. I will say Xi was a badass, as were Shang's sister, Aunt, and pretty much every other character compared to Shang, who was soft and definitely not superhero material. Awkwafina was funny and entertaining as usual, overshadowing Shang in most scenes as his character was so forgettably boring. Even his Aunt could kick his butt. Loved Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, extremely funny and his performance was genius. The outcome was the usual for Marvel Universe and even the pre-view for the next movie during the credits was lame; I guess they could only get Mark Ruffalo and Brie Larson, perhaps the only two Marvel Universe characters lamer than Shang, to set up the next movie."
"When i saw the trailer the movie looked awful.What surprised me in this movie is, its actually pretty funny.The first half was good the second half was okay."
This movie is centred around cheap laughs and gags. It takes all the bad parts of the old MCU movies and puts it into this film. A fart joke was the only thing left on the table.I literally feel asleep in the final act since it was so bizarre. This film drags on and on and on. In 2008 this would have been amazing. I'm shocked this carry's the marvel tittle. After end game Marvel had some excellent releases that continued to work on a wonderful story such as Wanda and Falcon but this was utter trash.If you wana watch an old school Kung fu movie then this is ok. I hope they don't drop the ball with externals tbh.I seen a few people leave the theatre. And what's up with these over the top good reviews seems sketchy.
"Honestly, on all levels this movie excels! The casting is perfect. The world building is creative, beautiful and faithful to its Asian roots. The CGI and location shoots are breathtaking. The fighting is the best I've ever seen and even the training ground sequences have an exquisite grace. The action was balanced by heart. I was concerned Awkwafina would take the humour to campy lows but she truly showed she has some serious dramatic chops. She was not the comic relief! They gave that honour to the Shakespearean stage giant, Ben Kingsley, Our own, homegrown üá®üá¶ Simu Liu was perfect for the part and his performance was world class. I could go on raving but I'll conclude my feedback by saying that this is in every way as powerful a MCU solo representation of Asian culture as BLACK PANTHER was for African culture. I gathered some feedback as I left the theatre, and got ratings of 7.5 (felt it needed more MCU content), 8 (saw many of the things I have just commented on). I've read the criticism that the storytelling was choppy, but I didn't find it so. For me it was more like chapters in a book, completely working together to create a world of content and design. Upon leaving the cinema, I was going to give the movie a 9 (superb) out of 10, but after reflecting on it, I don't know what they could have done to make it better, so, I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}"
"From the chemistry between Simu and Awkafina to the fact that Shang chi doesn't fall far from the mandarin tree it's just such a fresh take on a ""super hero"" movie, he knows what needs to be done and he doesn't have conflict he makes a choice and acts on it they really showed a true strict upbringing that made this Character so different to other Marvel heroes who have an internal struggle and Shang makes the hard decisions! Absolutely loved it and I want to see more of their universe and that's new cuz I usually say can't wait to see them in avengers, Katy and Shang need wedding bells I've never wanted a couple more than these two."
Loving the classic spirit being brought back. Also kudos for bringing the Kungfu Hustle icon on board this mega Fu-fest. This deserves a rewatch for many years since Joy Luck Club. This piece is made by heart surely.
"The music was soo good. The fighting scenes were great,they were flowing like a poem. The story was there, The acting was there. One of the Best Marvel movie and noone expected it."
"Marvel has supplied their fans with a fast, fresh and funny superhero adventure with unconditionally perfect amounts of exhilarating action and fascinating characters. The enthusiasm noticeably kicks off with sustainable writing, in which an appealing plot is arranged and the excellent protagonists are propped. Secondly, director Destin Daniel Cretton recieves the role of brilliantly executing the visually-awakening tale.There's no doubt that the real magic belongs to the epic sequences of fantastical action. With stylish martial arts battles and superb effects, Shang-Chi's epic movie lives up to both the hype and its genre. However, there are some ridiculous and unnecessary details. It's also significant to announce the fact that the amount of action is perfect! There's not too much to the point where it's tedious and not too less to the point where all that can be remembered is the dialogue.Marvel flicks usually include several moments of bland dialogue between the superheroes. It occasionally grows fairly unexciting, but most of it is surprisingly gripping and the entertaining adventure rules over it. Alongside the massively-praised action is humour and heart-pumping credits scenes."
"I'm from Hong Kong. Having watched Crazy Rich Asian, I went into this having very low expectations. But it really surprises me how good it is. The storyline is intense. Love the Mandarin dialogue. The amazing natural scenery. Tony Leung's charisma. The occasional humor. Kitty and Shaun's pure friendship. It's kinda empowering and touching to see people I watched growing up in a Marvel movie being able to accurately represent our own culture.Wish Awkwafina could have learnt and spoken Mandarin tho."
"Positive:
The characters are all extremely well done and acted to perfectionThe story is gripping and is paced very wellIn my opinion the best action of any MCU movieVillain was one of the best in the MCUNegative:
In traditional MCU fashion they use comedy at improper times and it takes away from some important momentsThe idea that Katy could hit that shot is bullThe cameo of Trevor/Mandarin was very overusedThe henchmen's motives are unclear8.5/10."
"I am not a Marvel fan and SImi liu was my least favourite character in ""Kims Convenience"" but I still liked the film. The first half is very well paced and quite entertaining. Though the building bamboo fight was done way better years ago by Jackie Chan in Rush hour. The second half however drags towards the end especially the dragon fight. We have seen dragon fights before and there was nothing original or exciting in this one, you just wanted the thing to end. Still worth a theatre watch for the bus fight,Tony Leung and Awkafina."
What it is is Wushu action entering Marvel Universe.I you like martial arts classics from Asia this is a film for you. If you like action and creatures it is for you. If you like subtitles and mythology and want 2 hours of escapism go see this.
"I've been watching Marvel films for years and while I do almost always enjoy them I often come out underwhelmed, Shang Chi actually managed to pleasantly surprise me and while I do think it dragged slightly in the third act I really enjoyed it.The film manages to balance it's humour and seriousness far better than other marvel property's and also incorporates aspects from other films without feeling too forced, instead adding to the worldbuilding. The action is possibly the best of any Marvel film and obviously takes a lot of influence from Jackie Chan films with I believe the stunt coordinator having worked with Chan in the past. The acting is all good with Simu Liu really shining and while I wasn't a massive fan of Awkwafina's character at the start I did find myself liking her development in the final act, I think Shang Chi manages to take what works so well about the MCU and polish it but this doesn't mean it's without it's flaws.I did enjoy the emotional link between the villain and Shang Chi, but I thought that there were far too many flash backs telling us of how this relationship has developed, I also think that the third act was a bit of a let down with the action evolving into pretty basic CGI fights and most of the personal edge that lent itself so well to the rivalry between Shang Chi and Win Wu being lost. There are also some big plot holes and things that just don't make sense, the score is underwhelming and I'm not a massive fan of some of the villain's costume designs, however while this film does have it's flaws it was still a very enjoyable movie that I will likely watch again, the cast is good, cinematography different from the usual stuff the MCU has to offer and I like that Marvel didn't shy away from using a lot of subtitles and having characters speaking lot's of Chinese. Very enjoyable and I'd recommend it to any Marvel fan. 7/10."
"You'll get: Vibrant colors & mographYou won't get: Blood, hardcore and feeling of being an adult watching something that wasn't made for kids.It's ok. It was always like that."
"This movie is worthy of praise, it truly represented the people, history and lore of the legend. Early reports said this was the Asian version of Black Panther and that could not be further from the truth. Despite sales, Black Panther was hands down the worst film Marvel released, until Black Widow snatched that crown. You get invested in these characters and had they cast a better side kick other than the unattractive, not funny, Awkwafina I probably would have considered a 9 for the film. I don't know who blessed her with the Asian female Kevin Hart title, but she is awful in everything. I hate her voice, hate acting and her face is 100% Cabage Patch.I know nothing about these comics, but I truly want to know more about Changs Father and the legacy of the rings. I would assume that will be explored in the sequel, but again, the writer and director deserve praise for how they unfolded and told the story. Phase 4 was not looking promising, but this was aa strong entry and worthy of the same praise Iron Man got. Shang may be the New MCU Poster Boy. The pace probably could have been quickened. At 2:20, it was probably at least 10 minutes minimum too long.That said, it's a great story, acted and directed well and the only irritant was Awkwafina. Comparing her to Kevin Hart is an insult to Kevin, she is the Asian Female Jerry Lewis and that is one clown I could live a lifetime without having ever seen!"
"This movie was highly anticipated and it held up to my expectations. As a massive Marvel fan, this movie had me fully engaged from start to finish. The fight sequences were amazing! They were very different from most movies, making them very unique. Every actor gave a wonderful performance as well. I'm not rating this one a 10/10 because of the dragon sequence towards the end. It was awesome at the start, but it seemed to drag out a bit too long. Still very entertaining though. Even if you're not a Marvel fan, I still highly recommend seeing this film. You don't need much Marvel background when seeing this one. Obviously, if you're a Marvel fan, you will for sure piece things together. Overall, Shang-Chi is a stunning film."
"I loved every bit of this movies...
It keeps you on the edge of your seat...
Loved Katy, she is probably the total backbone of this movie...Amazing action...Everything delivered for which Marvel's stands for.!!Woowwwww!!!"
There has been some great additions to the MCU so far this year and phase 4 is definitely an experimental phase; Shang-Chi is no exception.Visuals are pretty great along with great characters and acting. Shang-Chi himself was overshadowed by Wenwu (The Mandarin) in the trailers which didn't give you a good idea about the character but he shines in the film.Wenwu also manages to be a great villain. With a sympathetic drive to his villainy he manages to avoid the 1 dimensional template past MCU villains unfortunately fall into. His death put his story full circle.The film also manages to do a lot of world building in its 2 hour and 12 minute runtime in an impressive and not rushed way.Trevor Slaterey was a character that split the fan base in the middle when Iron Man 3 debuted but when we know the real Mandarin exists his character can be less divisive. He still remains a hilarious character and they don't forget his position as a Liverpool fan. His Planet of the Apes monologue was somewhat emotional for a kind of dumb scene and was well acted.The action is brilliant especially for the bus fight. The final fight with the rings was a fun and unique fight however the great protector vs dweller in darkness was a good looking yet somewhat boring fight that felt as if it didn't fit in the film and the hand to hand fights were brilliant.Both credit scenes are brilliant and the mid credit scene is one of the best in the MCU with appropriate cameos that leave you excited for the future. It also connects the film to the wider MCU. The second scene was great and allows excitement for the sequel to rise.Overall the film is great and has some great character moments however the final fight ends in a chi mess that perhaps didn't belong in the film.
Movie all together is fabulous nothing is missing but last 30 minutes will make you go crazy!!
This movie was one of the best if not the best marvel movie so far.the acting is amazing and the fight scenes are great.
This was a beautiful and breathtaking experience in Imax. Marvel has done It again and it do not disappoint!John wick level martial arts scenes and fantasy action you don't want to miss.
"Disney and Marvel have gotten to the point in their collaboration that much of their projects together seem to look and feel exactly the same. Every time a new movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes out, it seems like each filmmaker has to prove that their project is more than just another superhero movie. Luckily, the MCU's newest offering, SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS, stands on its own as a quality action film with some of the best stunt-work and visual effects of the year. The movie is not perfect, and contains some trite ""superhero"" storytelling elements that Disney movies often rely on, but director/writer Destin Daniel Cretton's clear talent behind the camera transforms every average scene into a larger-than-life sequence with high stakes for characters that are easy to invest in.The first act of the film admittedly plays out similar to many mainstream ""hero's journey"" tales -- an average joe (Shang-Chi) turns out to have a more-than-average calling and must return to his past in order to keep his father from doing evil things that might cause many innocent casualties. It seems like a combination of ideas that have all been done before. The movie is at its weakest when it sets itself up to be as interesting as the concept of the plot, but for SHANG-CHI, the gold is in the execution of this storyline.Firstly, the characters are interesting from the very start of the movie to the end, so despite the clich√©s the audience still cares about what happens to every character, including the fantastic villains. The comedic relief is also on point throughout, and the characters all feel personable and colorful due to the life that each actor puts into their performances. Simi Liu as Shang-Chi is a star in the making, similar to Chris Evans' turn in the first Captain America film, and casting directors all over Hollywood will likely have him near the top of their call lists after this. The performance of the film for me, however, is Tony Leung as Shang-Chi's father and the primary villain. Leung plays one of the most lived-in and memorable MCU villains since Erik Killmonger -- it is impossible not to feel sympathy for him even though it's clear that he has some serious issues with how he is dealing with his inner demons.At the end of the day, I believe SHANG-CHI will truly be remembered for the technical mastery put into the action sequences. Only time will tell if this statement remains to be true, but it struck me while watching: this film contains the most well-filmed action sequences of any live-action Marvel movie thus far. A high-stakes fight scene on a bus about 20-30 minutes into the movie made me realize that the filmmakers weren't messing around with their action: the stunt choreography is phenomenal, the visual effects and cinematography are stunning, and the action set pieces are inventive and pay homage to great Asian cinema of the past. The final 30 minutes of SHANG-CHI involve one large final battle, and it ranks as one of my favorite final fight scenes in the MCU along with Avengers: Endgame and Infinity War.SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is not perfect, especially for those looking for a complete reinvention of what it means to be a superhero movie. It adheres to many of the standards that have already been set up for the genre, but it does so in such a stylish and sleek way that it is difficult not to smile during much of the film. Cretton does a fantastic job helming this movie in a way that sets it apart from the projects that came before it, and ends up crafting the Avatar: The Last Airbender movie that I wish we had. Superhero movies may be running out of ideas, but if they continue to be crafted this well, then we should expect to see plenty more where this came from.B+"
"Good film, great action, decent characters. More than worth a trip to the theater, maybe more than once."
"SPOILER ALERT***** Great film except the fact that they let his gf in on Avenger business at the end. She trains one day with a bow and arrow, gets a lucky shot in the throat of a dragon and now she's Avenger material? Nahhhh.... Other than that, it was visually stunning and an action packed thrill ride."
"I have probably counted at least 5 Martial Arts Movies, Rolled up into this Movie!!Which is pretty good too see.If Marvel & Kevin Fegie, do a Cross Over with another Marvel Movie...
That would pretty awesome to see Shang-Chi, evolve into a much better Character..."
I'm a sucker for mythical creatures and fluid fight scenes; this movie had both. The two main characters were very likeable as well.This is basically a Marvel/Kung fu/fantasy mashup. It's not anything new but it IS a good time.
They definitely went all out with it ... freaking beautiful.
"Incredible. Everything from the cinematography to the storyline to the characters to the choreography-this movie has it all. Every character has a purpose, and the actors absolutely killed it. Easily in the top 5 Marvel movies. And the post credits scenes were great as well."
This is one of the best solo(origin) movie by Marvel.I highly recommend you all to watch this fantastic movie only in theaters !And Simu Liu just killed it!
"Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it's worth itWOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as i walked to the car. It's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier. And in general, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).The fight scenes in this movie.... how do i describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 10 seconds like i've noticed in the MCU.This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. Has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimesAnother frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. Awesome awesome awesome. That's all i'll say.Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores, with some exceptions, don't stand out. I think they heard. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it. It felt unique to this new franchise.Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. I loved all the characters, i loved all the casting choices, i loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but mannnnnn.Lmao i didn't mention the cinematography. Why would i wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters, that feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.Continuing what i said in my headline, i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. Don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other ppl. Maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life."" hyperbole, but mannnnnafter endgame finished phase 3 (yes i know spider-man), i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But i wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. WowAll in all, i adore this movie. You may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and i watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, inception, mad max fury road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. Only superhero movies i've given 10s are dark knight, dark knight rises and civil war.If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but i might not be able to! (3 viewings, 9/2/2021, 9/5/2021, 9/22/2021)"
"Movie is a Great treat for all the fans, this reminded us of last Marvel magic in theatre, but here is a twist, this one was fresh and different with some Sad themes,The Plot is fine but the, ACTION & the CGI dominated this Movie, its was so good and really its the strength of Marvel Studios and they have used it in a great way, Lots of Astonishing Scenes and Visuals are there which ll blow your mind.Casting and performance were also great, Awkwafina killed her role, Simu was also great, But Tony as the mandarian was the best. Movie is little fast paced because they wanted to show much and you can't show Everything in just 2 hours.But it was great to back at cinema along with this movie..."
"Seems like DC will be the king (again), because after No Way Home, they have literally nothing to care about. I used to like both, but right now DC seems to be so much more creative with doing all kinds of different movies. For example compare how extremely different are Joker and Suicide Squad, but both are great in their own way. But in Marvel, every movie feels exactly the same. Same meh effects, generic villains and cringe jokes."
"Wow, what a stunningly beautiful movie. Incredible fight scenes, beautiful cinematography, amazing story and villain. Loved every minute of it. Marvel has done it again!"
"Let's agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view. It depends a lot on the visual effects, its main characters can be funny but not nice, the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in Hong Kong, Indonesia or Thailand of the last twenty years. The only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome. The rest is routine, mediocre, tiring and bland."
"I really liked the actors they casted for this movie but I felt they did not focus enough on developing the characters rather than just throwing a bunch of CGI at you. The CGI was some of the best I've seen don't get me wrong, but it heavily shadowed the most important part of any movie: the plot. More time needed to be put into that aspect and the amazing Marvel CGI will follow. Seems to be a trend with some Marvel movies, just making it really boring when you go deeper than surface level."
"I came in the movie theatre just expecting a run of the mill cog in the MCU... and I came out seeing the best solo original movie since Guardians of the Galaxy back in 2014.It has a charming, kind of relatable antagonist. A relatively likable sidekick. A three dimensional antagonist. A far reaching redemption arc with Ben Kingsley. Good action pieces. Well placed emotional moments. The only thing it might lack would be some additional real world set pieces, but apart from that, I cannot find much fault with it.Hopefully, it gets a sequel and the character gets a stronger presence in the larger MCU. He frankly deserves it thanks to this movie."
"Nothing innovative or cool, just bunch of pointless visual effects and usual cringe humor of mcu movies."
The best possible start Also the worst possible ending The ugliness of the end cannot be described A kid can write a better ending than this ridiculous ending.
"Fighting coreographies are really good, music is perfect. The rest is awful."
"Shang Chi what can I say other than the first hour was enjoyable with the whole backstory of the two siblings and the origins of the ten rings and its rival clan, the martial arts was also great.....but then it did what I was afraid it would do in the 2nd half of the movie and that was become a poor version and knock off of crouching tiger hidden, with silly wire work and theatrics that makes it out of place that it was like two different movies got cut and stitched together."
"Great movie to bring renaissance to a fantasy Kung Fu movie Genre, and it kept its Asian roots in the story and characters. Shang Chi is a great movie for its MCU introduction. I haven't been in movie theaters for about 4-5 years. For this, I decided to go out and see in movie theaters, and I'm happy that I did."
"First Marvel movie I've thought about walking out of. Sit through nearly 2 hours of over explanation and a very slow moving plot and then experience the warbling furry talking animal reminiscent of the porgs from Disney'd Starwars. The amount of high rated reviews is very suspicious. Definitely not the best marvel movie, only a couple of scenes even felt like a marvel movie."
"Didn't know what to expect from this movie. But it didn't disappoint. It caught my eye. And when you catch a viewers eye, it means the movie did something right."
I wish marvel shows some balls with different genres. Had so many expectations from this movie. Wished its not yet another mediocre marvel movie. Half way through i felt indifferent.Not gonna watch another marvel movie until they move the goddamn needle.
"I understand how diversity is important and it seems like one of such thoughts in this film.But no, I felt so strange to watch this film the last night, somehow I was ashamed and embarrassed with the story and all about this film.Respect the diversity, understand how Chinese market is important for Hollywood today, but please keep some balances and make more natural films."
The dialogue is terrible no really big character development. Fight scenes were fantastic though but everything else really wasn't that good.
"I'll start with the strong part of the movie and that is it's visuals. The visuals are dynamically spotless. If I keep it simple then the movie is a complete cinematic experience. If you are going for the big screen experience then you shouldn't miss it.Now, except the cinematic experience. The movie lacks everywhere in terms of constructive and moving story telling. We only get to see incident after incidents and sometimes few of them doesn't make sense or felt forced as a scene.Lastly I'll say the movie didn't fall into my taste of movies since I'm more into strong story telling than breathtaking visuals. Anyhow, I good one time forgettable watch."
"Marvel played it safe with this one and made a standard film about a Chinese-American dude that knows kung-fu. Shang-Chi in this movie is nothing like in the original comics. Very americanized and people-pleasing take on the character. The movie has it's strong points like Tony Leung as the Mandarin. He feels like the only genuinely real character in the movie whom I can relate to. You can feel his every emotion and he is overall the best thing about this movie as so many have said. I actually enjoyed the original Shang-Chi comics because of their deep philosophies and introspective queries, plus the groundbreaking way they mixed action with interesting stories. This movie is lacking in that department. Generic martial arts action we have seen before, boring story for the most part, too many forced jokes and try hard laugh-inducing scenes, and westernization of Chinese culture. All-star Michelle Yeoh makes an appearance in the third act and does her famous tai-chi and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon schtick. Wong also appears and is fun as always. Abomination was in the film for just as long as he was in the trailer. Oh yeah, and Ben Kingsley reappears as Trevor Slattery, the fake Mandarin actor from Iron Man 3 and his story since then is addressed. That little creature he had was annoying rather than the typical cute character they intend to put onto all of these movies. Overall, I expected better, so now I may just wait until the new Spider-Man comes out to go back to the theaters. This was a filler movie that felt rushed. Go see it with the kids or something."
"The very first question to be asked would be, ""Why was this movie even made in the first place?"" It's one of those ones that tries to be too much and ultimately fails at everything. It starts off as a love story, then turns into ""Filthy Rich Asians,"" and then ends as a conventional action pic. A romantic feminist vibe is terribly present throughout the entire picture, which wouldn't be that bad if that was all it was about. But this movie has trouble settling on one single narrative. It's almost like an asian version of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show."" As is typical of this current generation of filmmaking, it's just another ""People running around doing things"" movie. The market is just saturated with these SFX garbage movies which this summer was full of!!"
"Finally!This movie was perfect,Nods to the Avengers in all the right places. Music is excellent. Casting is incredible. Visually stunning. Absolutely perfect. Would watch again right now. Haven't felt this good about a film in a very long time. Hoping to see more of Shang Chi in future MCU films."
"If it wasn't for the amazing cinematography I'd give it a 9. One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. Great action and set up good new character. Overall, a breath of fresh air, felt unique, enjoyed."
"This film was everything it needed to be and more, let's be honest no one had high expectations for this film but marvel once again raises the bar. First the film is simply stunning for the moving forest at the start, to the character visual designs it was truly immersive. Where the film truly shines though is the action scenes, the way they shot the scene on that bus from someone that appreciates films was MIND BLOWING! The one take where he's fighting across the broken in half bus was amazing very similar to daredevil.Marvel also had a great villain in the mandarin with a very relatable reason for his actions and not just wants the kill everyone. Comedy held up very well from the supporting cast the plane scene when there pronouncing his name was something out of rush hour and I loved it.The final act of the film was when I worried the most as I knew a CGI fest was coming but the action was simply the best I've ever scene. Riding a dragon and doing a dragon ball z blast with the rings it literally gave me goose bumps and actually hit emotion notes for me in the family issues department when he confronts his dad saying ""is this what you wanted"" when they are fighting next To the river. As a stand-alone film this probably works better but as a whole I am overly impressed with this film and I know people who understand film writing and shooting will know how amazing marvel are and have just performed üëç"
This film was exciting from beginning to the end. It was action-packed and complimented with witty dialogue. It was one of the best Marvel movies I've ever seen and I've seen all of them. I definitely can't wait to see what is next for Shang-Chi in the Marvel universe.
"There is no need to explain about a MARVEL MOVIE. And it's a excellent debut movie for a new hero. VALUE FOR MONEY! Greatest movie of all time in action and BGMs are awesome, Chinese tunes!!! Action Scenes are best in all time Marvel Movies... EXCELLENT VFX AND CGI
atlast I'm giving to this movie, I CAN'T RATE THIS MOVIE... EXCELLENT!You should've watch this MASTERPIECE..."
"While not in the class of Iron Man, GOTG, or Black Panther as top MCU origin films this film was extremely fun and offered a different type of MCU film. I would put this film above the first Dr. Strange & Ant-man movies and perhaps right on the level of the first Captain America & Black Widow films. IronMan, GOTG, Black Panther, Thor, and Spiderman Homecoming had better plots but Shang-Chi offered a ton of heart.The fight scenes were amazingly done and the climax of the film was actually visually beautiful. Some reviews said it was CGI heavy but i actually felt it was just right.When comparing this to other recent Asian led cast and stories i like this film a ton more then Mulan, SnakeEye, and Crazy Rich Asians. Highly recommend!!!'"
It was my first movie in theaters after Endgame and i should say it was a BANG. It has the best balance in fun and as well as adventures. Its the best start of a new phase. I loved it i saw it on 8ts 1st day of screening and i can properly say it that marvel was the only one expected by us to take us to theaters and they proof it by this movie. Its a must watch in theaters.Thanks.
"I am a Chinese. I have seen Jackie Chan's martial arts movies and Donnie Yen's martial arts movies, but I think this movie is definitely the best of any combat drama I have ever seen. The music and background story remind me of me My parents' education, and I can see that Marvel is very serious about this first superhero movie starring a Chinese, and it has its connotation. The Chinese dialogue is very standard. After watching it, I can enjoy endless aftertastes."
What an amazing movie. Great work. Can't wait to see what the future holds for those two characters.
Shang-Chi was a refreshing new movie to the usual Marvel styling of making origin character movies. It also was proper Asian representation!!!The casting was perfect!The pace of the movie spot on!The soundtrack was great!The costumes loved!The CGI well done!The talking and banter was all done at the right places!The whole time was really engaged into the movie! I recommend for all and watch it a few times too.
"Just got back from the theatre and the movie was absolutely amazing! The action that Marvel Studios promised us was beautifully delivered. Without saying much, overall, the movie is an action-packed joyride with subtle humour here and there, as expected."
Unlogical story plot. Luckily actors performance and fight scene save the movie. Simu Liu and Akwafina were great and funny. Tony leung had to be rank top 3 bad guy in MCU with more story in it. Rip to action choreographer Brad Allan. Thanks to Brad Allan bringing hk Jackie Chan fighting style in this movie.Bring back a lot of memories.
"I thought this film was a good break from the usual marvel super hero films, it was much more traditional martial arts film combined with some modern aspects.The concept was good and the film went along at a great pace. There was some good humour as well.I would really recommend it."
The movie was good but the story was repeated so many time I had a feeling while watching that its just a marvel version of the movie raya who's so much better.
"One again the studio brings jokes and the dazzling visuals over a good character development. After one hour, you don't care for the characters. Dysfunctional drama in the family and the chosen one - we have seen this a million times.This is the first time I felt sleepy for an action movie. I feel like i wasted my money, despite availing the Super Tuesday offer. The Suicide Squad was far much better in terms of storyboard.Over-rated, like Black Panther
What's next - Shang-Chi: Origins?"
The movie was one of the best movies that I have ever seen.
"No joke, I have not been on my feet since the scene of end game when everyone came back - marvels really done it again with this one.If you're into action packed with a vivid and dramatic story line that pulls the viewers into the moment. Father and son and family dramas suffer through increasingly dangerous scrapes. They discover each other's tragic histories. They're torn apart and put back together and fall into an impossible feat. Fate and geopolitics are put the test."
This movie is sooooo epic and beautiful. It had a good storyline and it really has a good first impression to the character. Love this movie.
"Another Marvel masterpiece, albeit a shift in perspective. We've seen the Greek and Roman mythologies come alive, now it's the Asian's turn. And what a story unfolds on screen!!!A little Crouching Tiger, a splash of Rush Hour 2, and a hint of Mortal Kombat combined with Bruce Lee's kicks and Akwafina's comedic timing turn this origin story into an original style for the superhero universe! Might have been bad if it were in the wrong hands, but actors and director, the crew and producers, all together show their love of the story in every scene!Behind every superhero is a story of loss, and it is doubly true for Shang-Chi! His journey to redemption is littered in Marvel lore, and the connections to other Marvel films is as suprising as it is awesome! Cannot say any more to avoid spoilers, but so much to love about this film it'll be hard to not yell some from the rooftop!"
"I have loved marvel movies since the beginning and the continuous entertainment through the years is phenomenal. Marvel continues to deliver every time!I was hyped for Shang-Chi since the first trailer, the trailers I would agree don't serve the film true justice, this is because of how little they show you.The characters are thorough and loveable, the storytelling is delightful and don't even get me started on the action. The action goes against all the issues people say about modern day action films. I believe the fight scenes are up there with the raids. They are choreographed fantastically, they are fast paced and adrenaline pumping.The theme of the film is sensational and it truly delivers. My only issues with the film is I think the second act can be a bit slow compared to the first and third act. Even with that said there are twists and turns along the way to keep you surprised.At minimum I believe it is a guarantee you will enjoy this film, Shang-Chi is one of the best, if not the new best solo character marvel movie.All I can say is if you love fight movies, action movies, marvel movies or fantasy films. This is for you. Even if you aren't big on them this film will by minimum give you a good time. It's a blast, I'm planning to go see it again soon and I can't wait! I am beyond ecstatic for Shang-Chi to be apart of the Avengers!Go see it!"
"The action sequences and cinematography are some of the best yet in the MCU. This movie is visually stunning and a pretty fun film for what it is, but the story in general was just poorly written and at times seemed amateur. There was about 7 too many slow motion scenes where characters randomly stare at each other, and the first 30-40 minutes of the film just felt so random and out of place. It is also weird that a dragon shows up at the end and sort of steals the show from Shang Chi as he is just about to start to shine and take the role as the lead protagonist. All the actors did great in their roles, but shoddy writing really brought the whole thing down for me."
"This movie has a lot of balance and solid chemistry. I thought there would be the excess kung-foolish and overacting but only a little. Excellent comedic time, decent storyline, several connections to other stories, and a sprinkle of Disney. They did copy a bit from Nobody, Speed and the Jaws character from James Bond but it was OK.You won't be disappointed."
The movie is so amazing . I was terrified with the visuals which were presented very smoothly. The direction and the screenplay were also too good. Simu Liu and Tony Leung did their great job in the movie. Don't miss the credit scenes !!
"Best mcu movie so far in phase 4. More action, more adventure, and more fun... If you've watched and did nothing, I don't know what you just watched."
"As a Chinese audience I feel awkward and weird,then I realized this movie is totally not for me ,it's for westerners, so I quit and left.By the way I hate Kung Fu Panda ,too. Panda looks so ugly in it."
"Ten Rings are stronger than I thought, Also it's the first Asian Marvel Movie, I hope for more Asian Marvel movies in future."
"The first real movie of phase 4, and it is absolutely awesome. From the story, through the action, to the world building, never before have I felt that a Marvel movie is an entire deep and elaborated story, as much as this one.The movie is definitely one of my top 3 movies in the MCU, and if it has any indication of the quality of the rest of the phase, we are up for an incredible phase!"
"I was very excited through the all movie, one of the best MCU movies out there. Has is at all and very surprising in his elements."
"The visuals were absolutley amazing, and the fight scenes were pretty cool too.But then, there's just not much more to talk about.The acting is average, and the story was simply not interisting. I personally don't hate this movie, (i mean maurice was pretty cute) but if you havent seen i wouldn't recommend watching it. It's not worth the money/time."
"I give it a 10/10 because the movie was so well made. It may be not one of the best mcu movies, but it sure is a good movie. The acting and the cinematography is so beautiful. I like how much was in Chinese, it made it all so realistic. I'm happy Kate and Shang-Chi didn't end up together or anything, they are good best friends and there wasn't room for it. The fight scenes are one of the highlights of the movie. Wow. Blown away."
"Absolutely amazing movie whether you care about Marvel or not. Probably the best one I've seen in several years. Go see it ASAP! You can even take the whole family. It's not crazy violent, although the end fight might be a little scary for younger kids. You definitely don't want to miss seeing it on the big screen! Home TV can't hold a candle."
Don't believe the hype this movie was just as good as black widow....which is not good at all.
"Shang-chi is a good and more than a marvel movie
Its a combination of Black Panther and Thor Ragnarok
Funny, Stunning action, visuals, great locations, and background score
Simu lui has done a good job and he doesn't hesitate to bring his best performance and we need to talk about akwafina she is great as funny as Paul roud ...The conclusion: after watching we fell in love with Shangchi cast."
"First of all, what's up with people these days? Are they aspirations really so low they claim this as good? What happened to good story telling? Those writers get millions and come up with this nonsense.The cgi was alright but what does it help if you can't tell a good story. It should've focused more on the conflict between father and son. So wasted."
"No start, no middle, no end, no goodie, no baddie, no love interest, no tension, no shocks, no message, no mystery, no point."
"Shang~Chi is absolutely brilliant, go see it at your earliest convenience. The fight scenes were almost balletic & I was on the verge of tears & roaring with laughter at some parts. I came out of the cinema feeing the same way I did after seeing Black Panther, this film was so needed. Easily straight into my top5 MCU films."
OMG THE MID AND POST CREDIT SCENE OHH SO AMAZING AND THIS MOVIE SO FANATSTIC.
"The physical raw fighting sequences alone turns you into a giddy kid glued to the screen hyper focused to not miss a single beat. Consensus: You will miss almost all beats cos the fighting is that fast and you wont be able to catch them all even if you could pause and rewind.I miss these type of movies focusing more on the physical aspect of fighting turning it into an art-form, and more of a struggle to force the character to master the skill in perfection before attempting to use it. The result of failure in physical fights are more deadly and the stakes are higher.Surprisingly, this move had a lot of soul I missed from other older similar movies and a rich landscape of interesting characters and creatures. This movie also had a splendid cast attached with some bad-ass women who got to fight a fair amount themselves which I loved. Great watch. Can't wait to watch it a couple of more times so I can catch some of the fighting beats I missed."
This was the first movie we've seen since the pandemic and it was enoyable.Hope to see more of these characters.
"One of the best marvel superhero origin movies. Great kungfu element with stunning portray. A great opening with the ten ring history and fantastic martial art scene. The castings are great. A great viewing experience that touches on friendship, family, and of course Marvels universe."
"Awakafina ruining another movie. Her acting is baaaad she not funny, the movie is pretty boring so much CGI it makes ones head hurt I can see why they didn't accept this movie in China it was baaaad.K thanks byeeee."
"I grew up on Marvel in the 70's, 80's and 90's. Sold my comic book collection and bought a new car and full scuba gear when I was in my 20's. Marvel in the 90's were addressing real life issues such as PCP, HEROIN AND OTHER RELATED ISSUES. Then we had these B-grade comics. Most of the time I didn't even bother reading them because they were so predictable and crap. To waste the money of this magnitude on this Disneyland garbage is an insult to Stan Lee."
"Well, I would have had more fun, I think, if I was aged between 6 and 25 years. Waaaay too many corny jokes & stupid, added plot lines to progress story, the ""tell it to me like I'm 5 years old"" type of story telling - this happens for the first 20 minutes or so along with the eye rolling scenes and bad jokes, all forced comedy.Then it gets a little bit better going, but soon after, here comes the kid gloves, the really annoying Asian sidekick/girlfriend, Aquafina something and oh, wait, not a single sign of blood or any really deaths, chopped, broken body parts shown. Like a Disney action movie for pre-schoolers at times I'd say.It has its pluses with the Excellent karate and stunts, CGI too.But man, this was not made for anyone to really enjoy a fine, 'take me away into fantasy' - not if you are over 30+ years imo. Or only if you are perhaps a huge comic nerd and man-baby.Fair rating from me, but I'd Not watch again unless I'm about 75 years old and infantile again."
"Ten Rings or is it Ten Bracelets? I will leave the research for you and the Marvel fans debate, and how accurate this movie is to the orignal comics. Focusing on this movie I must say it was flat right through until we get to the magical lands. Cultural mythical accuracy is sadly pushed aside by the writers and animators to retain a very standard plot. Characters' poor dialogues didnt help but the odd joke rarely did succeed. And I was very disappointed that there was a very poor attempt to capture the classical and contemporary Kung Fu element in the fights - it was limited and opportunity largely missed. If this movie was not apart of the next grandeur Marvel phase, I would have not be surprised to see another attempt/ reboot in five or ten years."
"I'll be brief.Clearly much effort, thought and funding has gone into this flick but it only goes to show that one can assemble all the right ingredients in a recipe and still make a meal of it.It has good action, but the live action CG is stale and the transitions always evident.It has a solid storyline, but the padding is average.It has good actors, but in support roles only.In a movie where you know the hero will ultimately triumph, it's all about how you get there.This journey was underwhelming."
Generic super hero story. Fails to connect emotionally with the audience. I have seen a 6 minutes short anime film named 'Shelter' and it could connect with me in such a short time. However this 2hrs long movie failed to get me emotionally connected to any of the charecters. Just some good looking mindless action sequences. Expected more:(
Incredible start to finish! Cast is perfect! Mind blowing special effects. Can't give enough praise! Go see this!
"The film has action in it, but its not only about fighting. There are bad characters, who are indeed not entirely evil. There are good characters, who are not without mistakes and weaknesses. Besides I loved the storyline, the characters, the acting, and loved the music. I do not give a damn about the colour of the actors skin in any of the films. It is an awesome film, thats all."
"I give an automatic 1 to every Marvel movie. They are all the same. Boring, idiotic, propaganda. They have single handedly ruined the film industry. Well not single handedly. The propaganda has, and that's in many movies. But they have single handedly made what use to be a much anticipated, original movie, that comes out once or twice a year, just another bargain bin film. Their movies are paint by the numbers and rehashed over and over and over again. I absolutely despise these movies and comic books and anyone who fanboys them. When a person even likes them, that speaks a lot to who they are. Just dull, boring, morons. Mentally stunted and intellectually void. The day the Marvel Universe dies will be a great day. I just hope it comes soon."
"For starters, the cinematography and the CGI are pretty nice. However that's where the positive ends.The fighting choreography is ok, not bad but not great at all. For example even Mortal Combat did it way better with way less. Also it follows the usual marvel formula of a lot of CGI in the fighting scenes, but this time they blew of the roof with it making those scenes feel completely detached from the world they're in.Concerning the characters, Shang-Chi isn't really there for most parts of the movie, taking a few steps back in his very own movie. A lot of things that other characters did in their time in the spotlight should have been done by him, there was no reason for him to not do those things. Causing him to be a neglected in his own movie, basically a background character. As for the female leads, one is just plain annoying and really serves no purpose(you'll know instantly when she appears). The other is an over-the-top strong woman actually getting most of the screentime, which don't get me wrong the actress acts nicely, but the way she is presented in the story and the way her character has come to be and is established is just unnatural and feels like she's just someone who has activated IRL-cheats, it just feels like they took a real shortcut with her character whilst there was so much they could've done to make her really likeable and immersable for you as a viewer. However the way they handled her just makes her feel like a 2D cardboard character that used cheats to max her stats.As for the story and dialogue. The story is just abyssmal, really lacking in content and feels like something a hungover student would drum up last-minute after a late night party. The dialogue feels wooden most of the time, just really unnatural and don't even get me started on the ""humor"" which is overly forced and just really bad.It feels like a movie that knows what it wants to do, but not how it wants to do that and just goes at it in a dozen ways leaving to much clutter and sidesteps for it to feel like a coherent story. If only they had chosen 1 or 2 things and stuck with them it could have been a decent flick."
"The way marvel fanboys(Marvel having one of the worst fan base, toxic and childish) praise this CGI crap is pure comedy! The story is trash and the jokes are as we all know already: cheesy, cringi and lame! But bcz it is a Marvel movie, of course it is praised! Doesn't matter of Marvel make a movie about a dog barking for two hours, the toxic fan base will still say about the movie: ""it's a masterpiece"" 2 stars for some entertaining action scenes! And the lady is ANNOYING aSF!!!!!! I really dare to say The Suicide Squad from that marvel clown: James Gunn is better than this full of CGI trash! My opinion! It was like watching a cartoon with stupid(almost all of them) fighting scenes just for the ...for the what? For the enjoyment of marvel incels!"
"Marvel universe 4. Not watched many of them before and know nothing about this movie before watching, except Tony Leung from our Hong Kong! Plot is always similar, but the fighting on the bus is good. The last scene between the dragoon and monster is also good. And Tony is just so so so smart and handsome!"
"The visuals in this movie are top notch. There is a new world to explore. Good acting, perfect cast. If you are a Marvel fan, go watch this!!"
"Best marvel movie yet! Chicken. Loved this movie and I hope to see another one, very different from the rest."
"A visual treat to relish!1. The VFX was, of course, brilliantly executed and the details were so very intricate.2. The cast! They absolutely stole it.3. The story was beautifully written with a perfect pace and placement of scenes.4. The absolute winner for this movie was the soundtrack. The music fit the narrative extremely well and I as an audience was totally soaked into it. Also, MCU's new style of patently crafted melody for each scene depending upon the narrative mood was an absolute delight to watch.5. Completely, worth every penny.A 10/10 for you Shang-Chi!"
"One of the best Marvel Movies! Great action (the best I have seen so far in Marvel Movies) and visuell stunning, the right portion of humor and loveable characters with depth.In terms of the cinematography this movie seeks its own kind in the MCU. The character and plot developments are interesting enough to keep ones attention throughout the whole movie. This is not your typical Marvel Movie, but something unique and refreshing for the MCU. Even not
Marvel fans, who just want to see a good fantasy action flick in the style of Chinese/Hong Kong
Movies, can be well entertained by this movie. This is a movie to be watched on the big screen in the cinema!"
"If you've watched Aquaman (which was pretty mediocre) then you'd see a lot of similarities with Shang Chi. The hero origin story formula is plain and simple, I don't know why it's that hard to copy/paste....
SPOILER
A guy who is ""chosen"", living in a world that's not his own => mad about mom dying when he's young=> get hunt down by a relative and their armies => discover mystical homeland => inherit powerful weapon => win, cause menIt was uninspired and for the most part- very boring. I didn't care for the main characters as they had no personality (even for Katy) nor motivation. The jokes were hit or miss, and most were not timed well. The villains were...Acting: 3/10
Action: 5/10
Plot: 1/10
VFX: 3/10
Fashion: 4/10Overall: 2/10- a disservice to Marvel fans and the Asian community."
This movie sucks. Generic predictable flat but mostly funky you disney.
"Don't get the high rating for this. It's just another formulaic mcu story, now with China as the backdrop. Also the cgi towards the end gets really bad."
"I have just arrived home from the cinema. Whilst I have seen the majority of the MCU movies many times, I hope I never see this one again. It's beyond me how some people can give this high ratings. There were some good actions scenes which generated the 2 stars but that's as far as it goes. I like Ben Kingsley, but what was his character doing in the movie? - it was completely out of place and had a ridiculous story line as to why he was there. However it did add the funniest part to the movie where he thought the apes in the original Planet of the Apes films were actually apes. My wife, who is a big MCU fan, also thought it was poor. My 11 year old son thought it was OK because he was proud of himself for recognising Wong & Abomination. I am going to cheer myself up now by watching ' The Face of Fu Manchu' - that's go a proper villain in it."
"This film is... good,... but a little disappointing.Let's start with the positives. This movie looks incredible. The Chinese elements and Asian-American influences give this film a wonderfully unique style. The fight choreography is some of the cleanest ever seen in the universe. It all looks incredible and clear, with clear lessons learned from the works of Bruce Lee. Simu Liu does an amazing job and I ADORE Shang-Chi and a character. I cannot wait to see more of him in the future.Unfortunately, the writing really lets this movie down in a lot of ways. None of the characters in the film feel like they learn or grow throughout the story, including Shang-Chi. Shang starts out as a trained fighter who loves his dad but condemns his actions and he finishes the film in the exact same spot. I similar thing can be said for his father who also feels very stagnant. Shang's sister is unbelievably one-dimensional filling in as the badass woman type with no further depth beyond her painful American accent. The comic relief characters very much overstay their welcome and become grating as things go on. This is very apparent for the return of Trevor who should have remained nothing more than a 10-second cameo.The story itself is very messy and cliche. At the beginning of the film, we are presented with an amulet that is treated as being very important but disappears at the end of the first act. Shang's journey isn't really motivated with himself, but through an urge to stop whatever his father is doing. It all feels very hallow.I appreciate what this movie will do for Asian representation, but am underwhelmed by it simply as a film on its own, not unlike that of Black Panther."
"My review..
Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has easily joined my top 10 list of the best movies I've ever seen... just like that. Marvel has created another masterpiece alongside Black Panther with excellent cinematography, A-1 story telling from the origin, to the subtle demolishing of Asian American stereotypes, the cameos that bring the marvel universe into unity, and even to the timing of the comic relief. These characters knew the assignment and delivered top tier performances in the choreography, plus the VFX was on Snyder's team level, imo. Arguably the best Marvel movie to date. But also one of the best Kung Fu movies in its own lane. This new Phase in the saga has a bright future if they're coming in this hot. Let me find out, Spider Man.#marveluniverse #filmappreciation."
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the most mystical and beautiful movie in history! The music, the special effects and the acting all take you to another world. The film leaves you wanting a Morris of your own.The storyline follows a young man named Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). His father is a one thousand-year-old man and conqueror nicknamed The Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), who has only ever used the infamous and all-powerful Ten Rings for evil. When the Mandarin is set to unleash infinite evil on the universe, Shang-Chi has to stop his father.This movie is a cinematic experience. The fighting and choreography are out of this world. The long slow motion shots make the audience feel as if they are in a video game. Simu steals the show; every fight scene is flawless with his fluid movements and it proves just how hard he worked on his character for this film. Every audience falls in love with Shang-Chi; he's funny, with perfect comedic timing and he knows the balance between peace and violence. He encapsulates what the majority of young adults feel - like not being able to find their place in the world. The movie makes fans feel as if they've known Shang for years. It has wonderful flashbacks, which give the audience glimpses of his past, his pain and how his fears have shaped who he is. The film gives a wonderful all-around scope of this character that feels like a friend we've known all our life. It makes fans excited to see Shang-Chi again. Shang and his sister Xu Xialing are an iconic duo. They're both powerful and, while there's some tension due to their past, they put everything aside and let love shine through. Xialing is a role model, officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful women. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is perfect for AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) representation in cinema. It represents Chinese culture powerfully, shows what it's like to be an Asian-American in modern day USA, not to mention that Simu is Marvel Studios' first Asian-American superhero. Simu and Shang-Chi are writing history while also inspiring children and fans all around the world. The film delivers on all grounds; the cameos are shocking and leave you on the edge of your seat. Trying not to shout during the two post credits scenes prove to be a challenge. By the end of the movie, I wanted to sing the song ""Hotel California"" at the top of my lungs.This film reminds you to search for who you are and let your past guide you to who you want to be. Ever since his mother died, Shang has been trained by his father to use violence. When he arrives at his mother's village, he learns how to find peace within himself and the world around him. He learns to trust himself and to use the rings for good.I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 plus adults. It is available only in theaters September 3, 2021. By Heather S., KIDS FIRST!"
"Can't tell the tightness and profoundness of Chinese culture at all
The title is Shang-Chi, but I don't see where the ""Chi"" is. How to ""Shang-Chi""?The Chinese ""Chi"" refers to the qi that exercises the qi and blood in the human body, which can be cultivated and practiced by Qigong and other methodsBut I really can't see where the ""qi"" in this movie is?"
"The first thing that jumps out at you here is how uneven the acting is compared to the usual Marvel movies. Actors alternate between overacting, pathos and subdued attempts at coolness. Add the usual Marvel style self-referential wink wink humor, and the obligatory 30 minute CGI showdown with purple light themed villains and monster (for the... 15th time now?), and you end up with a jarring, nauseating tonal mess of a movie.It's the same movie over and over again, same exact story beats, same pacing, same style soundtrack, same jokes, same trashy special effects laden battle at the end.They tried to gimmick things up with Kung Fu here (because that's apparently what Disney think people want to see in movies with an Asian cast), but you've seen it all before dozens of times, and better at that. The martial arts fight in public transport has been done to death (recently quite well in ""Nobody"", but also in Marvel films like Captain Marvel), and in general the fights pale against movies like Matrix, John Wick or any Jackie Chan classic.The reality is that Marvel movies feel dated and played out, with nowhere to go except from one CGI battle to the next. Maybe Marvel would be better off switching to a series format, because the movies are just reheated microwave dinners at this point.Save your money for something original."
Superb Marvel Cinematic Universe movie of this year. And Marvel is back and I love all Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. In future Spiderman No Way Home will come and current Shang chi and the legend of the ten rings movie is superb. And in this movie fight scenes are superb. I love this movie so much.
"Awful film I wish I could get my money back, waste of time just awful."
"Awkwafina should not be the most interesting part of your $150 million kung fu movie.She wasn't great (sometimes she was a bit annoying, to be honest), but everyone else was forgettable. Shang-Chi himself was the generic ""slacker with potential"" character with no personality. And he was a live wire compared to the rest of the cast. Aside from Awkwafina, the others seemed to have picked one emotion (either stoic, angry, stern, or ""wise"") and stuck with it.Wait a minute, I forgot about Ben Kingsley. His appearance was a nice surprise (I think), but he was a wacky Disney animated movie sidekick with an awful-looking CGI pet monster (who was also a wacky Disney animated movie sidekick).Shang-Chi strikes me as an American-friendly martial arts movie. Not that I'm an expert on kung fu movies, but I've watched enough movies (including several Marvel movies) to know a factory-made action flick when I see it. The movie is very watered down.There was, for instance, no effort involved in developing a plot or telling a story whatsoever. It's almost the exact same plot as the CW's Kung Fu series. Family vs. Family.I wanted to enjoy the fight scenes (I can tell that a lot of effort was put into them), but everything looked fake. Obvious special effects mixed with artificial movie sets. The final battle was two giant cartoons wrestling each other.As a matter of fact, almost every scene in the movie was covered in computer graphics.I didn't hate the movie. I can see other people liking it. But I was bored most of the time."
"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" follows the same formula that's presented to audiences in any typical Marvel film; with that said, ""Shang-Chi"" gives you exactly what you expect, for better or for worse. There are no tricks up this movie's sleeve - there are no surprises. This film delivers a standard, well-executed superhero film, and whether or not you enjoy that will be completely up to you.I, for one, am sick of the standard Marvel setup; I admit I have superhero fatigue, and unfortunately, ""Shang-Chi"" follows that typical superhero setup to a T - what that means is an extremely bland film both in character and plot, with only a few sparks of light along that tease a more compelling movie. The best parts of ""Shang-Chi"" involve Tony Chiu-Wai Leung; he plays a surprisingly complex and sympathetic villain and stars in some scenes that echoed the badassery of Asian gangster flicks. One scene where he takes out a room full of villains was so intense that I wish the movie would've followed that plot line instead of the subpar narrative we were left with. So, yes, Tony is great - everything else in ""Shang-Chi"" is mediocre, including the titular hero.Iron-Man. Spider-Man. Black Widow. The Hulk. Dr. Strange. These are all Marvel superheroes that you can immediately picture because of their distinctiveness as characters. Black Widow is the sexy, badass assassin. Spider-Man is the naive but pure hearted schoolboy. Iron-Man is the cocky billionaire. Shang-Chi? He's the, um, actually, who is he? That's exactly what you'll be asking yourself because Shang-Chi barely has a personality in this film - his character is so dull and forgettable. And me saying that is in no way a slight to Simu Liu, because he's fine in the role; it's the script that does him no favors. When it comes to other characters, Awkwafina was in this movie, and I honestly was excited to see her in this because of how good she was in ""The Farewell."" And wow, my excitement was led astray because she was about as fun and entertaining as a prostate exam. I mean, sweet Jesus, she was so grating that I considered stuffing popcorn into my ears so I didn't have to listen to her speak anymore. Her jokes weren't funny, her dialogue was awful (I'm sure most of it was improvised), and her character was just plain annoying.""Shang-Chi"" was also a very boring film, stuffed with poor dialogue and loads of exposition that had me nodding off in the theatre. A lot of lines were so cheesy, and so poorly delivered, that I found myself rolling my eyes. ""Shang-Chi"" also has the same amount of bland, uncreative editing and filming that is present in a lot of Marvel films - characters walk from room to room, and talk about this subject and that subject. It's not fun, it's not entertaining, and let's face it, it's horrendously boring. But okay, you're willing to look past that if the action is good, I get it! So how was the action?The first act of this movie does have two good action sequences, and you've seen them both in the trailer - the bus fight, and the scaffolding fight. I hope you're not that big a fan of Kung-Fu, because after those two fights, you will no longer get well-choreographed action and will instead be treated to horrific CGI battles. I'm talking ring-on-ring action and unnecessary giant monster fights that had no place or purpose in this movie. And it's all boring to watch. I mean, you have basically the first ever Kung-Fu superhero movie, and you decide to only include two scenes of Kung-Fu? What were the creators thinking?""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was an exercise in disappointment. Instead of attempting to do something different, the film does exactly what you'd expect. And hey, if you love these kind of movies, you'll most likely love this film, and that's great - I hope you do. But if you're at all tired by the exact same formula that all superhero movies follow, ""Shang-Chi"" won't manage to lull you out of your superhero fatigue."
Boring and silly CGI. Has Ben Kingsley finally come down to comic roles in kids movies? Sad for him. Wanted to get out and run. Decided not to watch Marvel or any of these super hero stuff in theaters for the next 1-2 years. Will wait for streaming services to show these. .
"I nearly fell asleep in the first 15 min of the movie then it picked up a little,after that it was so boring i got up and left half way through the movie."
"Rush Hour + Crouching Tiger + Aquaman.It might be the most entertaining movie since Winter Soldier.The movie was almost great, but the standard Marvel Formula drags it down."
Shang-Chi is action/fantasy cinema peaking. It is beautiful and so well choreographed I can hardly wrap my head around it. It is powerful and elegant and strong. This was a very awesome world to walk into for 2 hours. Cannot wait for the next installment.
"Tbh I m not really into the Marvel's. But this one looked really good and fresh. So I had high expectations but was also ready to be disappointed as, well, it's a Marvel.BUT, omg, it was way better than I imagined !Real and very well choregraphed fight scenes where not everything blows up, badass women who are not shown as inferior and, thank god, are NOT SEXUALISED, dilema ""the bad guy is a bad guy ?"", good humour (thank you Awkwafina !), respect of the asian culture (at least not huge mistake and direct disrespect but I m not an expert) and good ending where the spectator is satisfied but it still let the possibily to other stories.So, yeah, great movie !"
"This movie is very good, the fighting at sick, action was on point. I will say the first half of the movie was better then the 2nd but overall it was a fun action movie, couple dumb parts but it's very enjoyable. Like a 7.6."
"This movie is amazing!! Scenes are incredibily beautiful, fighting scenes are bomb, acting is great, plot is great as well, even the casting overall was pretty good.It was one of the best solo marvel movies and definetely the best marvel's debut so far."
"10/10An excellent story superbly told. Flourished with colour, visual spirit & awesome fight sequences.A diverse cast who each shine in their roles amongst a load of action, moments of humour, bits of drama & a tad of romance.Some of the best action scenes I have seen since Captain America & The Winter Soldier. Albeit a lot of difference between the two fighting styles they still stand out individually.Go & see this movie in Gold Class in a recliner with a snack or two. Highly recommended. Even for those that do not follow the Marvel franchise. It is worth watching for the story, action & humour."
"I went into this movie with a real open mind and I have to say that I was kind of disappointed, for me, the acting felt below par and the story felt very slow moving and didn't really go anywhere. I LOVED the fight scenes though, it was really cool to see pure hand to hand combat and martial arts be the centre of a MCU film. Overall I was not very pleased walking out of the cinema, I didn't feel attached to much of the characters either and there was no pace to the movie."
Another hit from marvel. Mid credit scene sets up the future of the MCU.
Great action and aventure movie. Easily one of the best MCU movies and that is a lot to say.
Amazing REAL action. Not sure if actor simu liu knows martial arts at all but his fighting scene surely makes it look like he's a possessed martial artist. Funny & beautiful. The beginning Taichi scene was so pretty and soothing. Worth every penny! 3D is a must.
Shades of crouching tiger hidden dragon in the fight scenes. Beautiful cinematography!But c'mon AquaFina is cringy! Please no more. I was hoping she would get sucked up by the soil sucker demons...
"I have seen best movie after endgame,,,awesome movie and great visuals,,,MARVEL YOU ARE BEAUTY."
Shang-Chi and the legand of the ten rings is definitely a great movie to see.
"If you love Marvel, Mcu, disney, Asians martial arts and movies in general. YOU WILL LOVE THIS. Man what an amazing story, screenplay, action and emotional film. And the fantasy elements were epic and it was not what I expected. He. Shang-Chi is my new favorit hero. Ofc I watch everything and love everything thar Marve and disney does with the Mcu but it was awesome because I was born watching Jackie chan, Bruce Lee etc. It was little slow in the middle but good slow not bad slow, thanks to the story and direction."
Middle part is boring but the ending visuals more like a anime live action it was good but not that good I meann I rated for the actors and their hardwork.
Marvel created another masterpiece. And this has various types of action and that was wowüò≤ this movie is must watch for marvel fans and non marvel fans because this movie is treat to watch üî•üî•üî•
"This movie was so great! The cinematography, choreography, plot - it could not have been done better. Marvel hasn't made such a masterpiece since Black Panther."
"It's better than the Snyder's cut, the sucide squad the Nolan's trilogy and anything DC would put out in the nearest future.proves the marvel universe can truly explore other genre like Kung Fu/martial arts thanks to this movie we successful introduced that genre into the mcu along with spy thrillers like winter soldier and black widow, while DC is still recycling Batman and Superman and the rest of their generic characters (ü§£ü§£ fans of generic characters calling the movie generic),next etarnals cry harder."
"Plot is expected, acting was okay. But overall, the movie was not so great."
I'm just in love with this movie it's so good it's a masterpiece it's so good it has great action scenes the Villain is amazing simu is fantastic akwafina is amazing it has a great representation the female characters are incredible everything is great.
Watching this move was like watching a clown act in a circus.
"Simply put, this movie was bland. Plot follow a simple acceptance plot, of Shang learning to accept he is his father's son, with no surprising twists or changes to the plot to make it better. Shang himself seems to be watching everything instead of actually interacting with his world. Action scenes were choreographed well, yet never seemed to fit for some reason. The ending was anticlimactic, and I expected more of a ending fight with the big bad. Visually speaking the movie is gorgeous, but i wouldn't watch it for the visuals. Shang as a character is bland and boring. The only character I felt was developed well was Shang's Father. Side characters are forgettable. If you are a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, then don't watch it as it doesn't fit at all in the timeline, with excessive fantasy elements that don't fit in the universe. Take this review with a grain of salt, as i went into this movie with higher expectations, but these are flaws i saw as i watched the film. Thank you for your time."
"I was really hoping to like Shang-Chi but I couldn't because of mainly three reasons: the first one is the most severe and it is the fact that I found myself very bored, especially in the last hour. I spent that time hoping that I could have the ability to skip 10 second at will like on YouTube. The second problem is the fact that Shang-Chi itself is not an interesting character as far as this movie treats him. He surely has potential and it is clear that Marvel will be high on him in the future and I still have hope but in this movie I think I preferred at least four characters more than him and he is the protagonist. And finally the plot has various holes, especially regarding the Ten Rings as a criminal organization. The visuals and the action are good but it wasn't enough for me to like this movie.PS: the mid-credit scene is the best of the movie, really liked that one."
"Imagine if in Hobbs and Shaw, Hattie did all the work and was the primary driving force, take away the comedy and just make it more or less boring and you've got your film. I don't wanna be harsh but this is trash; maybe it's a poor quality script, lack of practice, super hero presence or aesthetic.What's wrong with marvel these days? Since Daredevil writing/productions been going south."
Very Predictable plot. Me and my friend guessed correctly almost every major and minor plot point.
AWESOME ALL STAR ALL ASIAN-AMERICAN CAST. 100!! This is the best Marvel Film they have made. Beistifl scenery and the martial arts fight scenes were such a breath of fresh air from the typical scenes we normally see.
Went in with zero expectations. Came out extremely impressed. Worth the watch. Best martial art sequences since forever.
"It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window. More exceeding the expectations of a Marvel movie. Shang-Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride Martian Scorsese believes they are (I can't disagree, just note that's what I want)In comparison Shang-Chi is a lower level character. I am a fan of Marvel comics but got more of the references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references. Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fuIts a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it. It gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything I did not see before, in movies that did it better, but if it's about anything I did spend the rest of the day pretending I knew Kung fu."
"It honestly shocks me on how many people would give this movie a low rating. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the best films that has come out this year. This film has a lot of action, comedy and has soul. I felt very connected to this film. It's very unique and the actors performed very well. The cinematography, visuals were crafted beautifully and the music composition worked wonderfully together. A lot of hard work has been put into this film and it definitely shows. This movie deserves the rating it gets from me and I'll be seeing this again tomorrow."
"This is a visually stunning movie. With great action scenes and fabulous fights. The Asian and Asian American representation hits home for me, being a half Asian Canadian. And the comedy is there, when needed. There is also a nice addition of female power in the movie, that isn't too overwhelming, like the all female fight scenes in endgame and infinity war(no hate just my opinion). This is for sure a must see movie for action movie, marvel, or even just movie fans."
"Movie never left me hanging, liked all of it, good story and if there is a next one I can't wait."
Nice light fun. Great side story for the MCU that switches things up from the norm.
"Before getting into any of the review stuff. Congratulations to the whole cast and crew of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.This film is unlike any other Marvel project however, this was an absolute wonder.The potrayal of the every character was flawless. Perfectly casted each and every person.Visually very engaging. I loved the CGI it was amazing.The Chinese Culture was very well demonstrated which was a beautiful scene to watch.People should definitely go and watch this... It's worth the Theatre Experience.Very well done Marvel Studios with this film.Even though the pandemic is hampering with the Collection... I feel like this has been a blockbuster.Once again congratulations to the entire cast and crew.There's a new hero on the Block!!Marvel Studios SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS."
"People rating this low are just being overly picky, and I bet it's hard for them to enjoy anything... but for those of us who can enjoy things... this is just absolutely great!The fighting is spectacular, and there were parts that got my emotions going. Excellent portrayal of characters."
"Visually stimulating from beginning to end, funny, smart, and befitting the Marvel Canon!! Excellent film that's fun for the whole family! A TRUE MUST SEE!!!"
"I watched this movie last night and it was really really epic I feel like I was in Shang chi world so beautiful, so many beautiful and unique creatures. I didn't expect that Shang chi would be so good and epic, but sometimes the CGI it looks like not done yet, and when i watched in cinemas the studio was so full and people are so many laughing. I Was Really Proud that Niki and Rich Brian was in Shang Chi SoundtrackI really recommend you to watch this film now on cinemas!!!!! Ahhh god last night was so good.The Ending was look like Godzilla vs Kong maybe cause the monster and the monster was fighting and Shang chi weapon was so strong.When Mandarin acting died I was really sad but when that little creature come to him, mandarin said ""it was acting, come on pretend to be die"" and that was so funnyThis movie is doesn't feels like 2 hours but it's feels like 1 hours and I really really really wanna watch this movie again so bad. I can't Wait for the sequel."
I loved watching this and everyone was well cast Katy was very funny with shang chi and the plot was great if I could re cast anyone it would definitely be shang chi's dad as Jackie chan I feel he coulda really done well in that role.
"Showing no signs of slowing down hot off the heels of Black Widow, a raft of well-received Disney+ series and arriving not too far in front of the hotly anticipated The Eternals, Marvel continues to put in work that puts many other wheelhouses too shame, with the marital arts infused Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, yet another entry into the brands increasingly loaded catalogue of quality blockbuster releases.It's hard to pinpoint exactly what Marvel keep doing to maintain the momentum that started all those years ago with 2008's Iron Man, it's absolutely correct when many say a lot of these origin stories and event pictures follow a very set formula from A to B, but with an ability to attract some of the best actors working in the industry today and handpicking a raft of some of the most exciting Hollywood filmmakers around, Marvel have once more struck gold with the incredibly fun and inventive Shang-Chi.Quite possibly the most visually sumptuous Marvel film yet, sometimes feeling as if Marvel has meet with Ang Lee/Yimou Zhang and in my mind the Marvel film that features the best choregraphed action scenes yet from the spectacle heavy brand, Shang-Chi is a big screen blast that is freshly directed by the upcoming Destin Daniel Cretton who here has got his just rewards after his great debut Short Term 12 and the sadly undervalued The Glass Castle came before this big-budgeted ride.Infusing his film with a great energy and charm that is enhanced by the work of leads Simu Liu (in a career launching turn) as our likable hero Shaun/Shang-Chi, Awkwafina (doing her usual but fun schtick) as Shaun's bestie Katy and Tony Leung as the unfortunate villain of the piece Xu Wenwu, Cretton has turned out to be the perfect choice to start off the cinematic journey of the fist swinging Shang-Chi and helps instill in his film some nice differences to what we've come to expect from comic book blockbusters of the modern era.Most notably for the film is the exciting use of hand to hand combat that is delivered spectacularly in two stand out sequences on board a moving bus and then bettered alongside a high rise building in Macau, both these set pieces are easily some of the most noteworthy of any Marvel film yet while also benefiting the film other than its Asian infused eccentricities is the fun relationship between Shang-Chi and Katy than never bothers with adding extra baggage to add weight to their believable and fun friendship.If there was a major drawback to Shang-Chi's many wins it is in an overdrawn finale, a major problem many have acknowledged previously when it comes to Marvel films, Cretton and his team can't quite stick the landing for Shang-Chi with it being a little too long in the tooth for its own good and slightly overblown and while it features some incredible imagery and technical wizardry, the films rip-roaring start and strong middle section gives way too something lesser.Final Say -Another huge win for Marvel who have here with the help of director Destin Daniel Cretton and his talented cast, created an instantly likable cinematic universe that provides the comic kings with one of their most unique and exciting playgrounds yet.4 chicken-pigs out of 5."
"I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.Disney work through the numbers on this film, there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin.The acting is good, special effects are solids and the story is not bad.There's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans.I would actually pitch this at 7.5/10, not quite an 8 but higher than a 7Those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark, this film is not that bad."
"A solid origin story for MCU's newest Avenger.If I were to summarize how this movie made me feel, I would say it was like a crossover of Raya and the Last Dragon, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and a mega blockbuster Jackie Chan film but with the never-tiring humor of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For the first time in forever, I didn't need English subtitles for English conversations in an MCU film. Thank God for Asian-Americans haha.I want to leave out Simu Liu and Shang-Chi himself in this review because I think this movie is more about Tony Leung's character, the Mandarin, than it is about Shang-chi. This movie's central themes are grief, loss, moving on and finding passion in life. All these are heavier and deeper with The Mandarin than with Shang-chi. This film is like a beloved ancient Asian tale brought to life, crafted with respect and participated by the probably the best people for their roles.So many familiar faces appear in this movie, and it is always nice to remember which films in the franchise you saw some characters in and how they are all connected with each other.I am so excited for what Shang-chi can offer from here on out to the rest of the MCU. Asians really are winning with this representation in the Avengers. This movie is a homage to many superhero fans who are Asian. Asian kids finally have superheroes in the MCU they can see themselves in."
The scenes in this movie are great. The pictures look fantastic and the Chinese world is wonderfully filmed. The characters are well-written and the villain is arguably one of the MCU's best. Really fun and good movie. Highly recommended.
"Review of ""SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE 10 RINGS"". The newest from Marvel and what a sensational one ! Technical fight-scenes, strong Martial Arts/Kung Fu, lots of humor, elegant moves and original language. Our main hero and heroine are Chinese, so we can expect some traditional karaoke scenes and perhaps a dragon or two. Based on one of the Marvel Comics, let's leave it to that, there's no need to compare the book with the film. Just enjoy both.The story itself is a classic love story, the things we do for Love. But as always we have the battle between good or bad and the grey area in between. Whoever owns the 10 rings will be the master of his fate. Invincible and troubled at the same time. Power comes with responsibility.This must be the 12th time for me to fall in love with Tony Leung, all over again. Such a charismatic actor (from the film ""In the mood for love"") as always intense and charming. His intriguing smile is a trigger to be more careful. It's an exclusive quality. Is he serious or are you the next victim? No doubt, he's always in control of every character he plays. Here, he's the badass, Xu Wenwu, with a big lust for power and he has the 10 rings to help him achieve this never ending hunger for more. But there's more to him than just being strong headed and bold. When he meets his opponent, a female force so overwhelming , it awakens tenderness and modesty in our villain. That's how you win, use the yin-yang, it works every time. There's more to Life than just battle and gaining power. Victory has many shades and combined with Love, Life becomes paradise. However, this is a huge action movie, so brace yourself for lots of twists in the storyline, with surprising animals and hidden secrets in some people's hearts. They are all fighting an inner-battle, holding grudges and making the same mistakes every time. Why are they hurting inside? We have to look at the ghosts from the past , because ""you can't outrun who you really are''. And that's the centre of all the action. Our hero Chang/Shaun has a troubled journey ahead, becoming himself, restoring his given powers, reconciling the past with the present in order to obtain the balance of the world. And that's exactly what Marvel does best !! With beautiful fight-scenes, all fully orchestrated with calculated blows and kicks, such graceful, exquisite and delicate moves. Like a perfect dance. And who else than Michelle Yeoh, our Martial Arts-diva (from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon '') who has elevated her profession to an allround level. It's such a pleasure to watch her in fight-scenes, she has an elegant and experienced style. New star on the horizon is the other fighter Xia Ling, she has the badass attitude, it comes natural to her. She delivered great action.The women fighters are equally blessed with skills (usually in chinese historical drama), with the exception of Awkwafina (plays Shaun's pengyou/friend), she has other know-how and she's good at it. So no need to compare, if you put all efforts together, there might be a chance to defeat the enemy.Tony Leung has such an important character here, his acting is quite impressive and in a pleasant way he takes the limelight from our hero, who seems okay with it. Not sure it's because of the storyline, or his status, or even his image on the poster. He's literally the boss there. That's probably the power of the 10 rings, whoever wears them will rule the world. But beware of jealous competition and deceit in the name of Love. Even in the Marvel Universe rings are magical, centred around great powers and endless possibilities. They are worth living or dying for. All in all, a very interesting and action packed movie. Very entertaining, very smashing/thrashing and a very good one for a date-night. Or see it with your friends/family. Enjoy the ride ! MUST SEE !!"
"I'm not going to downplay this movie for it's action, visuals and comedy (but not as much comedy as you'd expect from a Marvel movie). If you just want an entertaining movie, I think the MCU has figured that much out at this point. Oddly enough, Awkwafina is the best part of this movie. I like her better in this than other things I've seen her in.The main character, Shang-Chi, really sells this movie. Simu Liu knocks it out of the park with his perfomance. He knows how to play an everyman. His chemistry with Awkwafina works well and are the best scenes in the movie. I thought it was interesting that, like many other marvel characters, he's a superhero who could be a regular guy walking down the street. You wouldn't know unless you knew his backstory (and believed it). I also liked the whole transition where he faces his true identity in finally confronting his father (the main antogonist).So the weakpoints, it's just as you'd expect. The villain is about as 2-dimensional as it gets. I didn't really care for him even as the credits rolled. The fact that he was Shang-Chi's father is literally the only thing making him relevant to the story or remotely interesting. Even the whole Ten Rings super power didn't completely sell me. It looked cool but beyond that, it was a guy with metal rings on his arms...which makes him...the most powerful man in world history? Sure, whatever.The other (and I would say biggest) weakpoint is the story. Like I began this review, this has great visuals, action and is a generally entertaining movie. BUT...I can't help but think there are Marvel screenwriters who are copy/pasting stories from previous Marvel movies. The third act was borderline ripped from Black Panther. It's a shame because I think this movie, in a vacuum, is really something special without elements feeling regurgitated from the MCU's back catalogue.Look, I get it. Sometimes you want the same thing. I'm not going to stop you from watching Marvel, Pixar and Disney cartoon movies (or their live-action remakes). But I personally have never heard of Shang-Chi from the comics, barely knew of most of these actors and just feel less invested than I was pre-Avengers: Endgame. It feels odd waiting for X-Men, Deadpool, Wolverine, Iron Fist, Fantastic 4, Blade, New Avengers and others to join the MCU but we're watching this while we wait. Do we need this many MCU movies? I guess that's not for me to decide."
Action scenes are really well choreographed but this movie I felt brought nothing novel to me. I didn't feel thrilled or excited while watching this movie.
"Great movie, entertaining and great fight scenes. BUT, in regards to the marvel universe , I've seen this movie before. Just different ethnicity and settings but same storyline that marvel uses to bring in another superhero in the mcu."
Marvel and its magic .. just watch the moving picture and watch till you jaw drops .
"I thought the movie was really great. The fight scene, the story, and the character. I would definitely recommend this for people to watch."
"Felt more like a Disney production than a MCU movie. The supernatural aspects especially seem like they were sourced from a Disney workflow.Good character development, especially for the Mandarin, but some stuff seemed glossed over. The final ""Boss Battle"" was a bit of CGI overload, at least for me. Much more than any other MCU movie.Despite my specific picks at the movie, it's very enjoyable. From an Americana perspective, I'd put it a bit below Black Panther. At the time of this review words have been said that makes any followup of this movie questionable at best.There are two trailers, one middle, one ending. Interesting fluff but not important. Especially since such a followup may not happen."
"I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this. And on the whole it was very enjoyable and fun to watch!First instincts when watching were a little mixed. It was an odd start to say the least and didn't have any idea how this was going to go. And my first instincts on Katy were also mixed. I felt like they were trying to force the humour out on her and I found her character really annoying. HOWEVER..Once it gets going the film gets better and better. Katy becomes a great character and all the characters development and arcs on a whole were truly phenomenal! For me the best part of the film was the characters and seeing them all develop throughout.So is the plot good? To be blunt, yes! It's truly unique and uniquely done in so many ways, I don't want to give out anything that would spoil anything, but it's really not what you expect. That's all I say!just an add on for this point. I will say there was a couple of points where it was quite obvious what was going to happen (ie when sister pops up for first time, you know exactly how about 10 mins before it happens). I think the final battle scene went on a bit longer than it needed to. But these are minor points that don't distract you or take anything away from the film itself.I'll shut up now! I'll just say it's well worth watching. It's a great ""superhero"" to have and a great one to watch. And overall it's a fun, visually pleasing and brilliant watch. I recommend."
"As far as superhero movies retreading the same ground over and over like a pizza slicer struggling to cut through a dull crust, particularly in the current climate of overdone and overrated Marvel movies, Shang-Chi stands on its own as a very fun and endearing film. It takes you on a rollercoaster from humble jokes between friends to fighting brutes on a bus to eventually the epic battle you expected. Compared to some Marvel movies which are now feeling to make care about who I'm supposed to be cheering for in the first place, Shang-Chi is a much more likeable and worthy movie.In carrying out this formula, I think the movie does it perfectly. And I came to like the characters enough to be invested and enchanted by the events. The Chinese flavour of the movie helps to give it more rhythm and depth, at least on the surface level.Still, at the end of the day, this is another overbudgeted blockbuster action movie which makes less sense the further along you watch. Given how tight the first half of the movie is, I did find myself taken out of it by the insertion of Trevor Slattery and the obligatory ""cute little critter that knows everything"" moment. And while the inevitable final battle was very well done and exhilarating, it still exchanged logic and gravity for another slog through a chaotic battlefield of good versus evil. I also wished that Shang-Chi's father would start to make sense by the end of the movie, because he seemed enigmatic and layered at the beginning but came across as a stereotypical tyrant dad by the end.So overall, I'd say this movie is definitely worth a watch (and worth the hype) in the sea of superhero movies. It leads the pack in that bunch, but doesn't stray from it - for better and worse."
"A little different from rest of the marvel movies..new cast and all, totally amazing. Worth your time."
The effects and graphics are amazing but the story is so boring and predictable.
"This movie is both fine, yet very flawed. The first issue is pacing. It's quite exhausting. Action-break-flashback-action-flashback-action-break-break-break-flashback-action. It's as if you tried to first sprint, then suddenly halt and tip-toe-walk and then run a marathon only to sprint again.Second issue are flashbacks. This movie is riddled with them. And I don't mind them.. Unless they keep on returning to exactly the same scene over and over and over again with that difference that you get to listen to new part of the talk. I don't remember any other movie that was so riddled with flashbacks.Third issue are fights. Now this has to be broken in 2 groups; ""magical fights"" and ""down to earth fights"". The first was done terribly. Camera shake, way too close, badly lighted and confusing as heck. There was some vision, some idea, yes, but it turned into ""cgi slosh"". This could have been done oh-so-much better.. But we got pointless confusing close-ups then camera shaky-shaky moments instead. The second group reminds me of jackie chan movies, you know.. kung-fu stuff, which was great... To some extend.Fourth issue is main character. He's the extend from point earlier. He's like blank-slate punching bag in this show. He has no real emotions and just goes with the flow. He >never< speaks his mind and rather just silently mumbles his agreement for whatever plan others come up with. It was annoying. Really grating. Ok, I don't mind if MC is not an iron man of a character. But I had seen corpses put more action while being decomposing than Shang chi. Also he gets beaten pretty much all the time. There are only 3'ish exceptions where he shows real emotions. And again.. shoddy pacing cripples them slightly.The Second character, his friend - Katey (i think).. she was fine. She was active and I couldn't shake this feeling that she's the brains of the team with witty humor, while he's broody muscle man with past.There were few amazing scenes, which i loved alot, really. But beyond that it was just mediocre. Thank god it was ""just"" mediocre, considering what things marvel relases lately. Mediocre is fine. Really. Tiresome, extended to the point of exhausting... But fine! A (not so) solid 7!Oh also, there are quite a few plot holes and whatnot ranging from minor (assassins using stun weapons ONLY - lol) to extreme (spoilery stuff).. but at this point.. i just can't even bother. Just roll my eyes and force my brain to stop thinking about it. To become a script writer in 202x all you need to know is how to sniff glue with class and how to agree to everything corporate monkeys in expensive suits tell you.Should you watch it? If Marvel fan.. you already seen it. If you aren't marvel fan, but still enjoy sci-fi/fantasy... Eh... Not like there's anything better to do I guess."
"Every time I hear the Marvel opening in theaters, I get chills and I am SO HAPPY that I saw this film in theaters. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, kicks off a new wave of the MCU and I am so excited for the journey that lies ahead. Great characters, narrative, score, and action overall. Totally worth the watch! (Make sure to stay for all the mid/after credit scenes!)"
"I loved this movie! Easy to follow along with the story, great scenes and it was even quite funny. I was either looking amazed or smiling throughout the entire movie."
The first marvel movie where the fight scenes are not nauseating. The fight scenes are well choreographed and easy to follow.The story is well executed. Character motivation could have been better.Also it does feel like a prolonged BMW commercial at times.
"Great origins story welcoming into the MCU, this movie is a hit!Shang-Chi has an awesome blend of story telling, action and adventure and brilliant visual effects. Characters are very likable and this movie will make you laugh and make you feel just the right amount.Do yourself a favor and don't listen to the bad reviews, just go see it."
"Just got back from the Cinema, loved loved loved this film. It has got me so excited for the next phase of the MCU.Safe to say the ""Mandarin"" has fast become one of my favourite MCU characters. All hail the King!!"
"For me personally, that was a 10 out of 10 movie that I enjoyed the whole way through because I am able to ignore minor problems and I enjoy martial arts and stuff like that a lot in movies. This movie did however have some minor plot holes and confusing aspects which is why for most people it is not a 10 out of 10 and this is why I gave it a 9 out of 10."
"For the latest flick in the MCU Shang-Chi, it's magnificently assembled with a stellar cast like 'Crazy Rich Asians' stars Awkwafina and Michelle Yeoh combined with an interesting performance of Tony Leung as the villainous Mandarin. Simu Liu as the lead is a welcoming addition to the Marvel family with his martial arts skills and adds more to this ever-growing universe.The visuals, the fight choreography, and an interesting soundtrack to boot! It makes you think this is more like a martial arts fantasy film rather than a typical Marvel movie. I also took notice of the moral values and quirks usually seen in Asian families that it began to remind me of the most recent film Crazy Rich in a way in terms of valuing your heritage and roots, but learning that your past doesn't dictate what you should become many years later.At 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, Simu Liu spoke about what it's like to be part of Marvel. He was so humble to speak of it. After what I've seen in this movie, it makes sense on why he said at the panel of him citing Black Panther's Chadwick Boseman (respect) as an influence in taking on this lead role. Chadwick helped open that door for him, he took it, and made it his own for audiences who look like him.After all that's transpired in the MCU since 2008, I can't wait to see where else Shang-Chi will go next from here. I recommend it."
"Great movie and one of the best superheroes in the mcu, very recommend to watch:)"
"Most beautiful Marvel movie there's ever been. The set design, world building, and character choices - all top notch. Possibly the best fight choreography I've ever seen in a movie, outside of traditional Kung-fu films. I could see myself putting on this movie over and over again without getting bored of it. Absolutely beautiful work of art. Plot points definitely were meant to set up action scenes, but that's what a fighting film is supposed to do. Some acting choices were a little off, but I'm willing to sacrifice that in order to have experienced fighters play the roles. Tony Leung crushed it, absolute standout. Simu Liu was a treasure. Awkwafina made in a blast. Michelle Yeoh and Fala Chen added an amazingly beautiful artistry and depth to the movie."
"I was very sceptical about this whole chinese casting marvel movie, worried that it would end up like another black panther. Howwved the movie was a pleasant surprise. It captured chinese culture flawlessly, choreography is probably even better than winter soldier, with a lot of marvel style humor. However plot is has some weakness, but that is to be expected."
This movie is one of the best cinematic experiences I have had. It will live on as one of the best Marvel films ever. There was comical relief in all the right places. The casting was without a doubt top notch. It was a wonderful way to introduce a new avenger.
"Must watch, simple origin story with super Action. Marvel is back with a bang!"
"Visually stunning and good action scenes.Good film in general, do not have to be a Marvel fan to enjoy the film."
"Marvel has finally released a movie that isn't a complete abomination.Action was heavy in the film, with great choreography and clear shots. The villain of the film was well put together, there was no ambiguity or salvation fluff. The Chinese sequences and actors of the film were excellent. However, the American counterparts performed poorly; some viewers may find the American humour entertaining. For me, If Awkwafina's character was omitted, the movie would've been an 8/10.It's a long film, but it's worth a watch if you're into martial arts and superheroes."
"It was hard to believe that Destin Daniel Cretton directed this film, which is a complete contrast from his previous work. Tony Leung Chiu Wai was the only reason to watch this movie if you aren't a sucker for superhero movies. Shang Chi proves Scorcese's point on Marvel movies despite being surprisingly entertaining.It was good to see a major blockbuster from a non-USA centric point of view. Shang Chi's best movements are it's timed humour and martial arts fight scenes. The ending of the movie is a theme park ride with eye soaring VFX of two dragons which are supposedy fighting but we don't know it due to excess use of colour.On the whole Shang Chi is a typical summer blockbuster which is bound to entertain all demographics but it's linear storyline and under utilisation of Tony Leung Chiu Wai's talent is a bit underwhelming."
"The bus fight scene is one of the best action scenes of the entire MCU. Just for that scene alone, this movie deserves to be watched on the biggest screen possible. Shang Chi benefited from being a very unknown character and the movie gives him the opportunity to shine bright with his development. The story is really fast paced and even if the final act succumbs to the typical Marvel esque, it leaves you with a pretty solid good feeling while leaving the cinema. A really great MCU movie, a superb martial arts spectacle and a great step up for the Phase 4. Do not miss the two post credits scenes. The middle scene is exciting and the very last one is pretty intriguing. Bring it on, Marvel!"
"Another global treath.Another villain that gonna kill the entire reallity. (Speaking abault this, whats the name of the villain again? Oh, I cant remember.)
Another secret organization that ""shape the history"", ""take down government"" bla bla bla.Its not a good movie. The script its bad, some characters are forced into the movie. Even the CGI, too much CGI, and It is not a good CGI."
"Great visual at second half reminded me Kong, Godzilla Vs Kong, avatar and some recent Chinese movies. It has some of the best actions scenes in mcu."
"It's a decent fun adventure movie, and it is very much your run of the mills marvel superhero movie these days. You got action, fight scenes, CG, and a decent share of jokes here and there. But beyond that, Shang Chi is another wasted opportunity, because the plot is so shallow it really makes no sense. I never quite get why Shang Chi hated his dad so much, nor exactly what his dad's feeling is towards his kids. The plot takes you whatever way is convenient to get to the next big scene, and there is no character development or even any consistency. Nevertheless if you are fine with an action adventure roller coaster and don't care about acting or story telling, this one fits the bi. Solid 7 from me."
"Has few good moments before and after the interval.Few things i didn't like:1. Long forced expositions
1.1 xualin and katey
3. Convenience of finding Morris
4. Bmw car placement straight into the jungle
5. Can't they fly over the bamboo jungle maze
6. Superfluous acting especially the father."
"With a great list of successful movies, marvels has created bigger expectations. As always - good movie, eagerly waiting for part 2 üôÉ"
I enjoyed it. I honestly found it funny and the action was A1. Though I will say the plot was not it. There were no surprising factors so I practically predicted some of the scenes right.
"Preferebly to watch in cinema, sound efects, fights, visual, everything is satisfy.Plot wasn't speciel, some cliche important scenes, most of in ending, new wakanda, funded asian culture and mytology.Good for watch with friends and marvel fandom."
I thought this movie was ok it wasn't bad at all but it was definitely not the best McU movie. I really liked the martial arts fighting in the movie and I thought Shang chi where a nice character.now there where 30 minutes of this movie that we're really slow and I didn't like that. I would personally give it a 4 out of 10 stars.
I sincerely loved this movie! The characters are Fun to follow and the graphics are amazing !!
When I went to see this movie in the theater I was surprised by how good it it had good action and good comedy and good acting over all a great movie.
"It's been really polemic in China because of its original comics' racism. But to the movie itself, i can see Marvel's efforts to avoid it and its intentions to please Chinese audiences. And it truly makes sense. Hearing a large amount of mandarin dialogues was the biggest surprise for me. There are also many Chinese traditional legendary animals from Shan Hai Jing appeared. The fight scenes and special effects were really amazing, better than any others in the Marvel universe."
"Unfortunately its just another dime-a-douzen superhero movie.Nothing is different with this one, typical predictable story, cool cgi and thats about it.Cgi good like they usually are for these types but personally thats all there is.You can predict the next scene before it starts and you can predict the ending perfectly on point if you've been watching superhero movies.Has for Shang-Chi, theres nothing different. I got bored half way through and came back just for the ending. Wasn't impressed all that much.I think these should be released directly to streaming platforms. That would be a better fit."
"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of Marvel Studios rise with Shang-Chi, the master of Kung Fu. He has to face his past involving him with the Ten Rings organization and crate his future accordingly.I have to admit that I had my doubts about this movie but I was proven very wrong since it's an amazing movie. It has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice CGIs. For one more time Marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many Easter Eggs so, we expect more in the near future. The interpretation of Simu Liu who played as Shaun / Shang-Chi was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's who played as Xu Wenwu, Michelle Yeoh's who played as Ying Nan, Meng'er Zhang's who played as Xialing and Awkwafina's who played as Katy. The comic relief role of Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery was a brilliant idea that also gave something different in the movie. Finally, I have to say that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it, especially the fans of Marvel."
"This movie supplied everything needed to be a great movie. Beautiful culture, great storyline, incredible choreography, and straight up bad ass fight scenes. Overall great movie, and must watch. Finally a well written movie comes out!"
"FIREEEEE!!! After Disney messed up Mulan, Happy to see Shung-chi and pretty dope how they used 10 rings like kung-fu hustle. Also gave me feeling of first Ironman film. Definitely one of the best Marvel films out. Rewatch fs fs !!!Production: ‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§

"Don't get me wrong I liked the movie, but I may have put too much expectation into it. A lot of bad reviews have said the story was lacking, but I think the direction was lacking. The opening montage was a missed opportunity to highlight some history and maybe add some emotion. I mean Disney was able to make you laugh and cry all in one Up montage. Tony Leung really lit up the screen. I kinda wish Simu Lui spent a little more time refining his Kung fu moves. I'm nitpicking, but he was a bit stiff. Could've done without Akwafina. Some jokes fell flat for me, but I'm not a die hard Marvel fan. And lastly the disrespect of a magical mythical creature was icky to me. Not even Harry Potter steps on the face of a dragon. Overall it was good, but could've definitely used a lot of refining. Tony Leung mentioned in an interview that due to the halt of filming during COVID they had to rush to finish and it really shows."
"It's a cool chill movie.It's not overdramatic and it has fights throughout the entire movie, not just the end.What I loved the most were the visual effects.The dragons looked epic and the dragon battle was really cool.The movie also had some fun comedy in it.It's an entertaining movie with great visual effects.Don't expect a unique storyline."
"Black Widow kicked off Phase 4 with relatively muted excitement. Blame BW's performance on the pandemic, pirating, whatever. But for a movie that's several years overdue and months delayed, it was an underwhelming opening to the next step of the MCU both in story quality and action directing.Shang-Chi does a lot of heavy lifting and bounces Phase 4 back to Marvel's in-form output with one of the strongest Origin-Story films yet. A combination of a great cast and actor chemistry, palatable plot and storytelling, and the vibrant beauty of Chinese & Chinese-American culture interwoven naturally into the interactions between characters makes Shang-Chi an incredibly fun film for anyone not up-to-date on the MCU and an instant favorite for any die-hard MCU fans. And yet, even with each strong component that this film brings to the table, the most noteworthy highlight is that Shang-Chi has managed to seamlessly adapt Kung Fu choreography into the BEST hand-to-hand fight choreography that the MCU has ever seen. (Yes, in my opinion, it's better than the fight choreo from CA:Winter Soldier; that's no small feat). The action sequences here, backed by a well-fitting and punchy soundtrack make the action of Shang-Chi almost as exciting as that of the best Avengers movies.Not a perfect film by any means, some of the story elements are not fully developed and we also have the scheduled 3rd act CGI battle that seems to come with every MCU movie. Even so, the highs certainly outweigh the lows and in all, highly recommend seeing this movie. My thoughts are too cluttered by the awe inspired by the movie so a quick recap of the pros:Great action (no seriously, really great action. This is the John Wick of superhero films)Stunning visualsGreat soundtrackGreat cast, very fun interactionsTony Leung is incredible in this movie; the antagonist of this film is a Top 3 MCU ""villain""Simu Liu seems like a really great guy. Congrats on the success my dude."
"Shang-Chi is a movie that nobody expected. An exemplar with which we were not familiar that, not only knew how to exploit their low expectations to the maximum extent, but also developed a structured and dynamic narrative immersed in a MCU that does not leave much room for new heroes.Shang-Chi made its first appearance in Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin's ""Special Marvel Edition # 15"" (December 1973). A Kung-Fu master created in the middle of the genre's boom in the US in the 1970s, Shang-Chi is quite a quirky character.Played by Simu Liu, the protagonist is embarked on an adventure after being intercepted by ghosts from his past. Full of action, martial arts and a very own and attractive aesthetic, the film unfolds without delay. The scenes are punctual and always add something new. Even with a sense of humor that can get heavy on certain occasions (such as when Katy makes jokes in the middle of life and death situations), Shang-Chi finds its essence, exploits it and ends with a gold ribbon leaving the door open for future aftermath.Marvel and its production team never cease to amaze me with their new films. In a difficult transition period, given the conclusion of the Infinity Saga and the beginning of this new phase, the studio keeps its feet on the ground and continues a coherent thread of its interconnected universe. Regardless of the obvious mentions to the events of ""Avengers Endgame"", Marvel returns to do what it does best: including thousands of references, cameos and winks that leave the geeks like me open-mouthed and with the greed for more.The cast is incredible. I did not know any of the actors beforehand and they all dazzled me with their distinctive personalities and professional interpretations. The studio made a great work in synthetizing the oriental culture¬¥s mythology and beliefs. However, it is true that Shang-Chi continues to be a westernized vision of Asian cultures due to its falls into stereotypes of martial arts and frequent characterizations of the Eastern world in Hollywood. Despite this and to my surprise, Shang-Chi knows how to combine the best of both worlds, using humor as its best tool and taking its time to tell the story, avoiding the rush to get to the action sequences that movies of this kind have suffered
The protagonist's arc is round and fulfilling. It has cohesion and is true to its ideals from beginning to end. Thus, the villain (excellently played by Tony Leung) only contributes to the plot and does not fall into the corner of un-memorable Marvel villains. We send you a greeting, Fake Mandarin. If it hadn't been for the blessing acting skills of RDJ, no one would remember your existence.Furthermore, the film interprets the concept of ""grays"" very well. In a franchise that is ""infantilized"" at times, Shang-Chi does not stutter in telling the hard truths of reality such as unsatisfactory employment, unreal family expectations, childhood trauma, the dilemma about murder, among others. Heroes are not pure white. They have their shortcomings, they fight with their demons and that makes them more credible, more human.With a stellar sound-track, Shang-Chi is one of Marvel's most unexpected gems. It is amazing to feel and denote the love with which these films are made and the fidelity to the source materials. For example, the main character's leitmotif is a work of art and a composition that immerses us even more in the plot. Kevin Feige deserves all the praise, he is truly a man who knows how to sell his product very well and, at the same time, sell us something with great qualitative value.After the post-credits scenes, fans only crave more and rejoice in the near future for what remains of this phase. Now with the recent release of the trailer for the new Spiderman movie, one only has to cross out the days for its premiere and admire the attention to detail that they put into the making of the films, not only as individual creations, but as a large adjoining and a special set of films. Bravo Marvel.Postscript: I really love Benedict Wong. Is he the ultimate man?"
"I knew that the movie is actually good before watching it , before i watch it i knew that i will give it 7.5 , it's actually gorgeous with the visual effects and the fighting scenes was awesome and the music was good , i recommend watching it even if you didn't saw the last movies , there is a couple minutes i got bored in but the action is back after , at the end shang chi is very good movie for the eyes and fighting scenes are great."
"I really enjoyed this movie. My son and I went to see it Saturday of opening weekend, and I am so glad we did. The cinematography and choreography create a visually stunning movie, with a lot of Wuxia mixed in for scenes involving the mother and her people (thing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), with some more traditional MCU fighting in others (the bus scene and the fight outside the skyscraper!). Simu Liu is adorable and wonderful, and although I am not a fan of Akwafina I will say she did a good job in this role, and Michelle Yeoh is always beautiful and engaging in everything she does. However, for me, Tony Leung was amazing. He conveys so many emotions effortlessly. He is not a remorseless killing machine, he has a purpose, and although misguided, he believe in it. He's also smoking hot so he has that going for him. This movie reminds me of Black Panther, both have strong story lines and are visually arresting, and they don't need the entire MCU to move the plot. I would highly recommend seeing it; you won't ne disappointed."
"I loved the movie. It's very high on entertainment value and achieves a lot you would expect from a new character.Firstly, the storyline wasn't great but neither common yet it was sufficient to establish all the characters. And then hand to hand combat sequences were beautifully choreographed in 3 totally different settings - bus, macau, and at chinese wakanda. Great to see that almost 60% of movie time was filled with action sequences and remaining also was mostly action related drama. Background score, set design, and overall theme felt fresh.I rate it high because comparatively previous marvel launch movies were not that great, but definitely this one also lacks on few aspects:the lead isn't charming or charismatic in appearance. This is his first big break so maybe it improves later when he is more confident.The antagonist is easy. There was literally not a moment where you feel the protagonist is struggling. Probably he wasn't supposed to be underdog, but his drive and passion to fight was not convincing. Same for the antagonist.The rings meaning or power is not yet explained which is a bummer. I am not sure what to expect from them. Also 10 rings are kind of dumb weapon.Side characters/friends are supposed to bring comic relief however here it was pretty average.Small thing but the lead do not have super human strength or body, yet he can do those thing. Maybe more is revealed later but this is same problem as Black Widow.-Suit also doesn't add power. This bit was disappointing because in Marvel generally suit serves a purpose."
"Such a very beautiful movie in all aspects, there's a good story, there's an excellent acting, there are really funny jokes, and I was shocked when I knew that the budget of it is just $150m because the CGI was perfect and it's really hard to do but they did and they well done. At the end it's a very good debut for a new hero into the MCU and I can't wait until I see how the future of shang chi will be with the rest of the avengers."
"Absolutely loved it. IMO, it's the best MCU movie and that's saying a LOT, coming from me. It's original, has a great story, good screenplay, excellent fight scenes WITH the actors (not stuntmen), the villain has a unique agenda (not just to kill the hero or take over the world), the origin story is told perfectly, the superpower (the rings) is really interesting, and the music is fantastic. It finally bumped Iron Man down to #2 on my MCU list."
"The Good- This film blends all of it's genres in very nicely. It is one part martial arts. One part family drama and one part fantasy. One of the things the MCU is good at is telling stories from different genres and making them fit within the universe and this film does exactly that. This has some of the best fight sequences within the MCU. The dynamic between Shang Chi and Awkwafina's character has a very nice dynamic between the two and really play of each other. All of the characters play a part into the story and none of them really feel pushed to the side. The Villain is also one of the better ones we have in the MCU as he has these conflicting values and we see both his good and bad side. It also isn't very predictable to see what he is going to do next. Finally the director feels like they were given a lot more freedom than usual inside MCU films because of how the story is told there hasn't been many films that have been told in this sort of style or tackling these sort of issues. This movie feels like a significant film into the MCU and moving forward in the MCU which was one of my issues with 'Black Widow'. Overall it delivered everything you want from an MCU film plus some new stuff which I enjoyed.The Mixed- The humour made me laugh and I found some of it funny. But there is a lot of forced MCU humour. If you are one of them people who are tired from the quick one liners we have in the MCU then this movie is going to frustrate you.The Bad- One of the biggest problems is the MCU template in the sense that it has to have all these jokes, a massive CGI battle at the end and has to tie into the MCU in different ways. Some of the humour works in the moment but others just fell so forced.Overall Thoughts- Overall 'Shang Chi' is a exciting mix of the MCU, martial arts, family genre and fantasy. I loved the martial arts aspect but you can tell the MCU formula trying to cheapen the experience a little bit. However put it all together you get yet another MCU film that knows what's coming next. Yet not quite a top teir MCU movie. Overall I'm going to give Shang Chi a 8/10."
"It was really a great experience seeing this movie in cinema. Great visuals, action sequences and story. There is also no obscene scene (Kissing and Sexual activities) so great from that prospective too. Only thing that wasn't good about it was overuse of Chinese language in this film. Both Mid-credit and post-credit scenes are amazing too."
Disney Marvel has a perfect way of simplifying the comic books into something a non-comic book reader can understand and follow along with. In my opinion this is the perfect movie to watch and see the excellence of telling a story without overwhelming the audience with comic book lore. This movie was good enough to get me into the movie theaters. Well worth the price of admission. Instant classic üêâüíçüíçüíçüíçüíçüíçüíçüíçüíçüíç
"If you don't know Tony Leung's influence in the Chinese movie industry, I recommend watching Grandmaster by Wong Kar-Wai (probably one of the best Chinese movie in this century). The story itself really didn't impress me, because every Marvel movie sort of has a pattern by now, and the script writers are basically replacing different characters into corresponding spots. However, I do get Marvel's intention of enlarging their superhero community to outside of the western world through the huge amount of mandarin conversation. Also, as a typical Chinese, the movie's theme of parent's expectation colliding with the new generation's rebellion, really resonates with me. Specifically, Tony Leung's depiction of an adherent, reserved, and occasionally ruthless father is one biggest reason I gave this film a 7. Talk about character, I truly don't appreciate the performance of our protagonist: I think the long and dull middle section describing Shang's mother's death is simply trying to waste time and cover up the fact that this character has no soul. Aside from that, the actions scenes are pretty well-done, especially the starting due between Wenwu and Shang's mother. Go watch Grandmaster, it has better fight scenes of true martial artists."
Visuals alone can make you think about the awesomeness of the movie. Above that the blend of emotions in action scenes was a great approach. Strong acting by all the actors and Tony Leung was just amazing. A perfect treat for Marvel fans.
"Another Marvel movie that is worth watching and, if possible, in a movie theater. Before Feige and Marvel presented this future film project, I did not know anything about this character or the entire universe around him. That is why, when I was coming through the movie theater, my expectations wasn¬¥t high at all and the truth is at the end I felt so happy and wanting to follow more adventures of this new character that Marvel has given us. This movie goes through many genres, truth be told, fantasy, science fiction, comedy, drama, action and a lot of sense of adventure during the slightly more than two and a quarter hours of footage. Great action and fight scenes, marvelous set-pieces, very well choreographed."
I was excited for this movie anyways because I read the comics and I was even more hyped when I saw the reactions to the movie just before it was properly released. I watched it and yes it has it's moments it is good but not as amazing as people are saying. It currently stands at 8.1 on IMDb but it really should be mid 7s like 7.2 to 7.6 but not above. So keep in mind yes it's good but it has holes in the writing.
"WoW!!! Spectacular viewing from the MCU!Sean (Shang-Chi) lives in San Francisco and parks cars for a living with his best friend Katy, whom he met when they were 14. He's happy with his life. He enjoys karaoke.One day these bad, scary looking guys attack Sean and Katy on a bus and demand the green pendant Sean wears around his neck,,,Oh yeah,,, Sean's real name is Shang-Chi, and his father is the leader of the TEN RINGS terrorist organization. What?!?!?!?!?!?The visuals are incredible, and Awkwafina is hilarious!If I say anything else I'll give something away,, so,,,Go watch it!!"
"This movie is really good and not quit as expected. As a marvel fan, i was afraid it would end up like black widow, but it was way better. There is a good upgrade in marvel Villains compared to other solo movies. It has the marvel solo hero movie formula with marvel regular comedy which was a good hit in some points and disastrous in others. The background music is fantastic. A mix between modern and classic Chinese melodies. The acting was between ok and very good. The worst thing about this movie is the cgi especially at the last third of the movie. The world they established was wonderful but i feel like some details about some characters were vague especially regarding the mom. At the end, it is a good marvel solo movie and a quit upgrade regarding other marvel solo movies."
I think my rating is obvious since i'm more intrested in seeing Abomination and Wong than protagonists. Nice movie cinematic!
My thoughts on Shang-Chi are that this was a really good movie and it is actually one of the better Marvel movies. I really enjoyed this movie. The fight choreography was really great and it almost reminded me of crouching tiger in some scenes. It also gave me some Jackie Chan movie vibes in some parts like the way Shang chi fought. It really connected to the marvel universe really well I thought and it also expands it as well. The acting was top notch all around. I thought I was going to hate awkwafina but she actually did a great job she was really funny and she could get emotional in some scenes. A lot of the comedy landed but there was some minor jokes that weren't funny but I got passed those and the other jokes made up for it.the Mandarin was a really intimidating figure. I really thought he could destroy anyone. The big fight scene at the end was really awesome and it's a huge spectacle that had me on the edge of my seat. I loved how they implemented the Asian culture into the films plot. It also ties in some threads from pass movies that really made me glad to finally have answers for. The cgi was amazing and it was very awe inspiring to watch. This was way better than the last marvel movie and I really want to see more of Shang-chi in the future. I give Shang-chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings a 9/10.
"There's a lot to love about Shang-Chi. There's also a lot to grimace about. Both feelings lurk beneath the surface and draw awareness to themselves at various times, creating a wishy-washy overall impact.Where I'm critical? There's a bit of a haphazard pace to this film. Many scenes contain plot points and/or action sequences that are unbalanced in terms of what is glossed over and what is overly drawn out. There were serious opportunities to do some world building with the new ingredients provided by the vigorously refreshing Asian cultural influence, but it felt like director Destin Daniel Cretton was often going through the motions, checking boxes like he was playing Marvel bingo. The climax, while visually appealing, was predictable from moment to moment and really did not have me on the edge of my seat. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's villain also didn't quite stick the landing with me, though I've read that his character has really resonated with Asian audience members so I'll humbly accept that maybe his motives lay just a bit outside of my perspective. There were also several ""oh, okay, sure"" moments, lets call them, but a least the writers had the modesty to poke fun at themselves (see: Katy's awe at her own random overnight mastery of a certain skill later in the film).What I really enjoyed? The cast and characters, first of all. Marvel almost always gets this right. Awkwafina's charisma is palpable. Her character, Katy, never gets in the way of Shang-Chi's natural progression and is genuinely interesting in her own right. I also appreciate the writers' restraint in not simply using her as something to be exploited by the villains to distract/misdirect Shang-Chi. Meng'er Zhang is also a revelation as Xialing, Shang-Chi's scorned, steely sister. Although, a bit more clarity on what her characters' ultimate goals are would have gone a long way as her post-credits appearance left me a bit confused as to where she stands in the greater story. In regards to Simu Liu, I personally felt like he got a bit hoodwinked by the writers who really didn't give Shang-Chi a strong personality other than kicking butt. Regardless, I totally praise his performance and find him endearing to no end. I have faith that he'll really shine when he's plopped into the dynamic of the Avengers. As an aside, just wanted to give an obligatory shoutout to the visual effects and concept designs of the mythical creatures and surreal locations in the film. They really nailed it.To that end, a completely worthy addition to the MCU that sometimes feels like it's only purpose was to introduce us to the new toy in the Marvel universe that is ""the ten rings"" themselves."
"So happy to see movies like this in theaters again. The ones that give you that satisfying feeling at the end. Honestly don't know if is tight to chinese culture but look quite respectful to it imho. Also didn't know about the character before and the novelty didn't disappoint as instantly become one of the best heroes origin film both DC and Marvel of course. Most of the cast is unfamiliar to me but nothing that demerits the product, on the contraire quite surprised by the good performances. The figths are very well choreographed to the point to bring back the sensations of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. The effects are so well made that is very hard to find a defect to complain about. Mostly flawless to me. Remarkable the smoothness of the water scenes. Nature and creatures scenes are very well done too. Beautiful scenes appears with some regularity. Sound is terrific too. Is a Marvel movie and conserve the tone of all the previous ones. Enjoyable, interesting, not dark, well paced and of course well done. I give a 9 to counterpart the ones giving 6 star or less, but definitely is a solid 8 to me. Hope more movies like this appears more often as make super enjoyable the visit to the theatre (3D Imax worth it!)"
"I was excited to see this film even before it materialized into actual being. I remember thinking, ""This is going to be the next Black Panther experience...but with Asian representation!!!!"". I was so pumped to meet Shang Chi and watch his story unfold. And then...it got here. And I saw it yesterday and was SO SO SO disappointed. I found story telling bland and CGI filled, the action meh, dialogue rehashed from other films (especially the humor), and most of the characters one dimensional and non interesting (especially Shang)...but there WAS some heart in this movie. The Marvel movies at least have that at the end of the day. Even the misses have SOMETHING good about it. For most of the Thor movies it was Loki. For Captain America's first film it was Cap's overall goodness. And for Black Widow it was the introduction of her not-so sister. I found this movie heart to be none other than...the mother. Yes. I'm going to write that Fala Chen who played the mother of Shang Chi is the ONLY great part about this film. Honestly, she should have been Shang Chi herself and should be in the MCU alone. Because she STOLE THE SHOW. I wish we could have just gotten her story and her character, because it was WAY more interesting than anything that this film was trying to do. So, I feel like I didn't waste my money buying a ticket because I at least got to fall in love with the mother character and her story. But other than that, I'd say this was a miss overall and is NOT giving Phase Four a hopeful look for the future :/"
How are people giving reviews about it..it hasn't even released im confused.
"Best marvel movie yet! Chicken pig. Loved this movie and I hope to see another one, very different from the rest."
"Hands down one of my favorite additions to the MCU. The story is fun, unique, and refreshing. The cast is great - everyone has amazing chemistry. And the story is action packed and heartfelt."
This movie was so beautifully made that I cried from just pure excitement. I had forgotten what it was like to watch an action movie so well written and executed that it didn't need comedy every other second to distract you from the plot.
This movie was bad... it have to be bots behind trying boost this movies review ratings.
"Shang-Chi is one of the best Marvel movies in 2021 which can mean it really fits for a superhero like him. It reminds me of Mulan, and the Avengers movie at the same time. I can't wait for the sequel soon, too!"
"SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is being called ""the Asian BLACK PANTHER,"" and I think this is an inaccurate description for two reasons. First, Asian cultures have been explored in-depth by Hollywood since the 1970s at the latest, and in ways that sub-Saharan African cultures have not. But second, and more to the point, SHANG-CHI is really just a mashup of two Hollywood subgenres that have been around for quite some time: the ""ethnic discovery"" film and the ""stupid American tourist"" film.The ""ethnic discovery"" film is the more recent type and by far the more interesting, ultimately inspired by Alex Haley's famous TV miniseries ""Roots."" It documents the saga of a protagonist who learns - or relearns - about his or her heritage and embarks on a quest to fully embrace that heritage. A good example I can think of is THUNDERHEART, in which an FBI agent (Val Kilmer) comes to appreciate his father's Native American ancestry while on a case on a Lakota reservation; a more famous but fantasy-based example is STAR WARS, in which Luke Skywalker learns that he has Jedi blood. On the surface, SHANG-CHI definitely follows this pattern.Unfortunately, the movie's ""ethnic discovery"" theme is undercut by the clich√©s of an even older Hollywood storyline: what one film historian has dubbed the ""racial adventure film,"" but which I simply call the ""stupid American tourist film."" Common since the 1930s, this film plot follows Western (and almost always white) characters as they visit an ""exotic"" foreign land - often for purely exploitative purposes - and proceed to reveal their ignorance about the ""native"" culture. It has always been demeaning to both the ""colonizing"" and indigenous peoples, since the former are forced to make buffoons of themselves and the latter must bear the humiliation of not being taken seriously.SHANG-CHI is an ""ethnic rediscovery"" film in that two Chinese-Americans from San Francisco learn (and, in one case, relearn) about the culture of their ancestors; but it is also a racial adventure film in that they are essentially Westerners who travel to China and find themselves in the midst of a culture clash. While not white - and, in the case of the titular character, an immigrant - Shang-Chi and his girlfriend otherwise fit the role of the ""stupid American tourist"" with their unmistakably American accents, annoying use of slang, pointless pop-culture references, and wisecracking sarcasm. The twist here is that, like Kilmer in THUNDERHEART, they revert to their ""noble savage"" origins once they have traveled to an ""ethnic"" place and ""gone native.""Not incidentally, there's one more way in which SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS differs dramatically from BLACK PANTHER. While both are based on ""non-Western"" comic book sagas created by white men, BLACK PANTHER turns stereotypes about black Africans completely inside-out, giving us fantastic science fiction instead of hackneyed ""jungle"" adventure. But SHANG-CHI is just the usual ""kung pow"" hash about the Orient, presented ironically but also in a way that isn't terribly original.In fact, if there's another Marvel movie this one closely resembles, it's not BLACK PANTHER but DEADPOOL. Both combine wacky humor and serious (and even ""dark"") subject matter in a way that's very jarring and ultimately exasperating. But at least DEADPOOL felt fresh."
"The story is super boring unfortunately, because I think the actors are doing a good job with what they have, and are generally likable.The cgi is weak, especially in the last half of the movie. It's just ... tacky.Regarding the fighting, some people compare this to Jackie Chan movies, but it's nothing like that except for the first fight scene. Then it's wuxia fighting, over the top dramatic kung fu that's not believable. It's less Ip Man and more Hero. And that's bad.The cameos are shoe-horned in. I mean come on, why would Wong be at the golden daggers club? The abomination? And the scene in the end with the two well known heroes are also nonesensical and feels like it's there to justify the movie in the bigger MCU.Also, when I watch a Spider-Man movie, I don't want to see just Peter Parker. The same is true here, it's just in the movies last scenes we actually get to see Shang-Chi instead of just Shaun the kung fu guy."
"Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package. It has lots of brilliant trademark MCU humour and tongue in cheek quips. It has exceptional action which I'll get into a bit more. It also has solid connections to the rest of the MCU, balanced well between being its own stand alone film but laying hints of how this is going to fit into the wider story of Phase 4.I'll start with the action as this is what Shang-Chi is famed for. Quite simply it's awesome. It has the best hand to hand combat the MCU has seen, and sequences that are steeped in Chinese culture, with the rhythmic style of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon woven into the fabric of this film.The cast was brilliant. Simu Liu was a fantastic lead, and I'd be happy to see him grow into a big player in the MCU. Awkwafina as expected was fantastic, adding so much effortless humour to the film.What I really love about Shang-Chi is that it has a very well explored and interesting antagonist. This can't always be said for Marvel films as there have been a few phoned in villains, but Shang-Chi doesn't come close to falling into this trap. Tony Leung really sold his role and gave it a lot of power and emotion.In terms of plot they did a fantastic job of introducing us to this pretty obscure character. There is a lot of exposition and plenty of flashbacks, perhaps too many but I appreciate they had a lot of background content to feed us so I can't grumble too much. I loved how the plot was so mystical and magical, very much feeling like an epic adventure.Yet again Marvel Studios knocking it out of the park!"
"You may (or may not) find Shang-Chi to be a fun movie to see in theaters. The film is full of tropes, from the narration over an origin story, to an inner city urban flip on an distinctly Asian character, to the CGI we're to assume is real (that never quite does translate as real). This well-intentioned film about discovering who you are doesn't seem to know for sure what it is. For example, there is tie-in to the larger Marvel universe, but almost out of corporate necessity to set up subsequent movies versus narrative need to set up a deeper story inside itself. There's also more profanity than other films, often used as a momentary gag that doesn't advance the plot. Even the final sequences land in dark places that confuse the family storyline versus clarify it. If you're looking for a fun night out, perhaps you and your crew might enjoy this film... or you might crave something more significant."
"The actors and choreographers are overshadowed by an incredibly poor script.Too many things are cliched, rushed or just generally bad.I found myself cringing at many parts in this film.What could have been a fantastic story of a son & daughter having to overcome the misguided grief of their father became a film full of misjudged moments, undeveloped characters and a cgi mess."
Awesome movie. Good to see it marvel movie in theater.
Hands down one of the best solo marvel movies made.
"A friend saw this shortly after it came out and said he wouldn't mind rewatching it, leaving me rather surprised. A couple of days later another friend dragged us out to see this, at a 4dx screening, no less. I got burnt out on capeshit after ""Ant-Man"", but this looked possibly interesting enough to be enjoyable.Aside from the overwhelming shaking of the 4dx chairs, the film itself is a plothole-ridden nonsensical mess, led by unlikeable characters and a complete waste of its two most famous cast members, Ben Kingsley and Michelle Yeoh. As can be anticipated from modern high-budget films, it's also laden with impressive CGI and good-looking visuals, and the monsters are cool. It's just a shame that it's such a waste. The ratings must be artificially inflated as well, as there's no way anyone with an IQ higher than room temperature would actually think this is a good film. But let's get into some more details.Starting from the opening, we're introduced to our unremarkable protagonist and the annoying female lead. ""Katy"" is as useless, annoying, infantile, and uncharismatic as one could imagine. I couldn't have written a more grating character if I tried. On top of her, we're given some very awkward, stilted dialogue that was probably supposed to be cutesy or something, but fails dramatically. After the end of the first act, which terminates with the bus sequence, the film becomes slightly more palatable. Instead of cringing and facepalming and wondering why, exactly, I'd spent ¬£16 on this trash, I could at least watch the thing.Then we get into the nonsensical. After his mother got killed by the mob, Shang-Chi trained hard for years before getting sent to avenge her death. He killed her murderer, but then decided to feel bad, run away to the US and abandon his ten-year-old sister whom he loved, after telling her he'd be back in three days. His sister, who ""taught herself better"" just by watching the real fighters train, ran away 6 years later and founded an underground fighting ring in Macau all by herself with no money or support from anyone. Right. Shang-Chi's dad didn't actually want to kill his kids when he sent his mercs to fight them (including the big guy with the blade-hand), he actually wants his children's help to find their mum, who's allegedly still alive. They run away from the dad, stealing some BMW hatchback instead of a Land Rover or a Jeep for a trip into the Chinese outback. Conveniently, the car's turn circle happens to be just the one needed to traverse a perilous ""living"" forest maze that ""eats"" stragglers. Our heroes find the late mum's village, train for ONE day, and defeat all evil, including the dangerous merc army bent on burning the village down.Nothing in the paragraph above, and little in the film in general, makes any sense, including the fact that the bad guys show up to the village---the village they want to slaughter the population of---with stun batons and shock crossbows. I guess assault rifles wouldn't have quite stood up to the good guys' ""dragon-forged"" staves. Katy, the annoying American-born character who looks significantly out of shape, trains archery for a handful of hours before letting a much cooler character get his soul sucked out (RIP Master Guang Bo, I'll remember you) before landing the single lucky arrow needed to dispatch the eldritch boss-monster from half a kilometre away. She'd never be able to draw a real bow, let alone hit any target at all.Shang-Chi himself also trains for a few hours before defeating his dad and his rings against all odds, but the flashbacks showing him training with his mum as a kid at least allow me to suspend disbelief sufficiently to go with it. What I can't go with is the fact that Shang-Chi takes a full ring-empowered gut punch beforehand, which propels him some fifty metres, and would have ruptured his spleen or stomach. He's dead, Jim. I don't care about your plot armour.The final sequence also included so much seat shaking (4dx) that I could barely follow what was going on with the eldritch monster. 4dx was fine in ""Alita: Battle Angel"", but whoever the poor sod responsible for programming this film's effects was, he must have been out of his mind.The worst part of this is that the story has potential and could have been handled better if someone actually tried to make it logical. What, am I supposed to ""turn my brain off""? I can't ""turn my brain off"" because I actually have one. As a writer, I'd be laughed out of the room if I were to write a script as nonsensical as this. Guess that doesn't apply to blockbusters for some reason...Michelle Yeoh is completely wasted in an insignificant role as Shang-Chi's aunt. Ben Kingsley is back as his ""Iron Man 3"" role, a dumb Englishman theatre actor providing comic relief alongside Katy; a role that I recall people perceived as an insult to the character of the Mandarin when ""Iron Man 3"" came out. The sole difference between his and Katy's jokes is that I actually chuckled at a couple of his.A 4.5 is what I'd give, and I'd probably round it up to a 5, as the visual spectacle is decent, albeit dragged way down by the sheer inanity of the script. This unnaturally high rating, however, merits rounding mine down. I can't accept the rating is real. If it is, then people must be too willing to slobber up all the flashy corporate sludge thrown their way, which would be saddening."
"...Jackie Chan, Sandra Bullock's character ""Annie"" from Speed, a tribble (from Star Trek), Daenerys Targaryen, Robin Hood, a LOT of drugs, the ""sixth"" Beatle who left the band early to become a stage performer, a LOT more drugs and a pinch of ""How to Train Your Dragon"" together?Well, after you bring the concoction to a luke-warm temperature, you get...""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.""At first I was going to skip this movie, because it didn't look appealing to me. Then, I read a lot of good reviews for the film, so I decided to give it a chance.Note: I do not know anything about the comic book character. I generally like Marvel movies. I hate martial arts movies where people are walking on thin tree branches, etc.The first fight (between Shang-Chi's future parents) was boring to me. I thought if all the fights are like the first one, I'm leaving the theater. Thankfully, many of the fights were better.I read a lot of people liked the humor in the movie. I didn't find much humor at all. At least not the ""laugh out loud"" humor that I found with the latest Suicide Squad movie.The option for characters to speak English or not was all over the place. For example, Katy mentioned that she didn't speak Chinese very well. However, towards the end of the movie, one of the ""elders"" told her to shoot the arrow at the dragon's throat, she seemed to understand him perfectly fine.Speaking of Katy, I knew they threw her into the final battle just so she could deliver the crucial blow (with very, very little training). When the scene actually happened, I rolled my eyes.There were parts of the plot that seemed missing. Maybe I missed it while reading the subtitles at some point. I don't know. For such a long movie, I wished some aspects of the plot were a little clearer.Half way through the final battle, I just wanted the battle/scene/movie to be over.The movie isn't terrible, but I could have waited to see it on TV instead."
"Marvel's newest solo film that introduces an iconic hero from thier vast collection of heroes is certainly for the newer fans that didn't grow up with ""The Master of Kung-Fu"". Even Stan Lee (who was in charge of the company but didn't create Shang-Chi) has admitted he was a comic rip-off of Bruce Lee in looks and style. Adding a mystical and possible alien influence was in my view a mistake and not true to the character's story. Nor the reimaging of The Mandarin, which I found to be disappointing. Aside from the tired storylines which have become common in these Marvel films, the ending was a little over the top. Aside from these criticisms, I'll give kudos to a good cast and wonderful cinematography. If I ever get a faithful adaption of a Marvel comic I grew up with, I might be shocked. I am coming to the conclusion that these films are only for those under 30, since I don't recognize the heroes or villains. Not the worse film in the Marvel universe but not the best."
"Some good action scenes, but almost all of them are interrupted by out of place gags like the IG Live guy and Awkwafina for the rest of the movie. Really hard to stay invested because of that. It gets serious for a long stretch in the third act (where it crams all the character development), but the goofiness of the multiple buttons robs what could have been a decent ending of any impact. The characters are left totally unaffected by the events of the film making you question whether they are sociopaths."
"I thing, and very sure that Shang-chi: and the legend of the ten ring is going to a part of superhero movies ...
And Marvel Did Well with the movie by not realasing it on Disney plus like Black Widow."
"Definitely one of the top 3 MCU films thus far. Right up there with Avenegers. And easily the best movie to come out of 2021. It has a quality to it that is hard to explain unless you see it for yourself and even if you are not necessarily a Marvel fan or if you are feeling that ""Superhero movie fatigue"", this has a more universal appeal that transcends that realm."
"10 for Tony Leung, he leads the whole storyline, best actor in Hong Kong."
"Don't get me wrong, from a visual and colourfully fantastical point of view, this film was amazing.But for an MCU film, which we have all come to love for being so intricate and detailed, this film falls flat for me. It just doesn't make any sense with the universe that the MCU has built up to this point.Certain rules and historic lore has been completely discarded. And I think the villain of this movie is one of the worst and least relatable of the entire franchise. It just made no sense. And even during the climactic ""battle"" things were happening that just weren't explained. We just kind of had to accept what we were seeing as possible without understanding what was happening.And unfortunately the character depth of most of the cast in this film was very poor. Certain characters were sort of just there for the sake of it. With no real purpose or direction, and they were some of the closest characters to the main guy!I don't often say this - infanct I've only said it once before when leaving the cinema after a marvel film, I feel disappointed, confused and left thinking ""they could've done it better"""
"This movie doesn't really know what it is supposed to be. A Drama? A Fantasy flick? A Superhero Movie? A Bromance? A Comedy? It tries way too hard to appeal to every possible viewer. That is why it achieves nothing. It started well with some really awesome martial arts scenes, but then the story got more and more confusing. There were more holes in the plot than in Swiss cheese. For instance, a 14-year old trained assassin apparently got bullied at school - really?? And WHY was this guy who played a British actor even in the plot? The moment he showed up was the moment I was done with that movie. And then there were the over-the-top magical creatures who probably were supposed to get some ""awwws"" from the female audience. But the most disappointing thing to me was, that the more interesting and more badass sister got treated the way women typically get treated in Hollywood: she got totally ignored. Why did the male hero get all the rings? She did deserve at least half of them. It's male storytelling at its finest. As usual."
"This move has literally everything. It's hilarious, got a crazy amount of action, and dragons (who doesn't like dragons!) I loved this movie the cast is perfect, great experience 10/10 no doubt. I don't know what it was missing but in my opinion it was the best Origin Story in the MCU undoubtedly."
"This movie is a must see. I walked into the theatre really not expecting much, somewhat expecting it to be a corny movie filled with Asian stereotypes. God was I wrong! This movie beautifully captured cultural nuances that touched a deep part of me as a Chinese-Canadian. The movie also featured seasoned actors in Chinese martial arts movies including Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung - brings back childhood memories. The cinematography was wonderful as always, but the plot was surprisingly touching. Also can we talk about how FIRE the soundtrack is! 10/10."
The fighting and visual effects are great.I also loved the elements of Chinese mythology.
"Everyone who grew up watching jack chan, jet li, samo hung, Donnie yen, and many others martial artists, must watch this movie."
"After long long time, something new and some refreshing. I am huge fan of Marvel world."
"Visually beautiful,good action sequences, great starcast but what ruined my experience was the over expectations, I went for this one after reading it's extremely positive reviews all around just like The suicide squad (even that was one was an average flick nothing else) but later turned out to be an average movie.. neither bad nor too good..."
"Terrific cast, fun character, and an enjoyable - if forgettable - story. This movie could/should have been solidly mid-tier MCU fare, but doesn't quite make it out of that Thor 2, IM 3 territory of MehCU.There are so many cool/positive things in this movie, that were just completely washed out by terrible pacing, weird story points (32 year old Simu, playing the world's oldest looking 26 year old), and criminally boring visuals. Seriously, who decides to make a super hero kung fu action flick, in which every fight is in shadow or being panned over/cut away from?Overall, there is enough fun just watching Simu and Awkwafina to make the movie fine if you're an MCU completionist, otherwise it's a safe skip.Bright Side: Simu as Shang-Chi seems like he's going to be a real fun character to add into the MCU, even if his debut is less than stellar.Alt Title: Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Thousand Flashbacks."
"The pacing was awful. The movie was so slow. It needed more fight, fight is good. The fight seemed like it was on 2 times speed. It was just meh. Would not recommend. Meh."
"I absolutely adore this film! The cinematography the acting the music the story. MY GOD IS THE STORY GOOD! Having wenwu be a sympathetic character that you kinda root for in the film is great! Wenwu is just the best marvel villain hands down no changing my mind. Well there was some flaws, especially when it got halfway into the film, it got a little fast pace, and I am not a big fan of fast paced films, but it got better by the point where Shang chi was thinking about how his mother died, and where it showed the flashbacks, the final battle was great until wenwu died, after that I didn't even know what was happening. Overall it was a pretty solid film one of marvels best."
"Good:
Fight Scenes Choreography
Storyline
Character Development
Father Villain
(Some) good dialogue
CameosBad:
Best Friend Character: 100% pointless / irritating
Forced Humor - karaoke, villain vehicle, faceless creature, Trevor, dialogue
Timing - become a expert archer in 24hours.Masked villain."
Action would last A few minutes and then back to talking for 20.Got old pretty fast and didn't need every back story shown for everyone after it was told by A character either.
If you want CGI and epic fight scenes this movie is for you but if want anything else you will be disappointed.
Just ask yourself where this movie would be without special effects.
"I rated it 6, just for the great acting of the father and main character, otherwise, the movie's story is so predictable, already consumed in the anime and previous asian-myth movies.Wasn't for the show up of Wong (and one other minor clue) no one could relate this movie to MCU.Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, but not MCU-good. Unless....the story is still to be connected, making this movie only a bridge to a greater story."
"Wow. I came into this film with mediocre expectations and I was absolutely blown away. One of the top 5 films of the MCU. Great themes, well-written leads, good chemistry between characters, top notch VFX effects, and the fight scenes were stunning! They were giving Winter Soldier hand-to-hand combat + modern Martial Arts w/ a twist. Everyone needs to watch this film!"
I loved this movie. Amazing asian representation!Very funny and intense. Brilliant fight scenes!!
"I have to give credit to the first ""real"" fight scene. It's really good. And looks like it was a lot of fun to film. I'd pay just to watch it but then you can leave. Everything else is really bad. Especially the power scaling. The main plot devise is a weapon that is inferior to a gun. Seriously. Then theres the plot hole of ""where's all the guns"" no one has guns? Yea it's a marshal arts film but John wick was too. Then it's not like marvel can just buff this character. The only way, would be to make him move faster but no way can a human move faster than quicksilver. And quicksilver couldn't put run a bullet. The only other way to buff him is if they just gave him a gun in combination and the rings would be used for Mobility and support but it's not some power weapon.And even if he did have a gun he doesn't even scale to war-machine because war-machine is bullet proof."
"They certainly picked the right director for this film; he seemed to understand that this script has a plot with too many generic elements and characters that are just serviceable. So, he really put forth the effort to craft stunningly choreographed, smoothly filmed action sequences that kept me more than engaged.Additionally, this movie has some refreshing bursts of imagination throughout, including introducing us to the Marvel land of pok√©mon.It's certainly better than Black Widow."
"Daniel Destin Cretton created a tranquil really well filmed marvel story driven fun time! Simu Liu and a surprise character were the best along Awkwafina which is always delightful. I really appreciate the direction of everything especially the effects, action, cinematography, and the silliness is good! Might be odd or understandable this is one of the best marvel films."
"Makes no sense, √°ll the scenes took so long, if you don't count these useless long shots, the movie would take 30 minutes. Horrible."
Wow one of the best marvel movies i have seen so far!
Total waste of time. Iron Man 2008 is so much better. Meh........
"The best super hero movie of all time. This movie is simply incredible in all parts, music, scenery, direction, plot, even the dialogues are incredible. And being an Asian American I felt represented by the film, basically incredible."
"It's an entertaining yet slightly boring film about family... I went in thinking it would be about learning about the Dark Magic of the MCU and the keepers of the magic. Instead of giving any answers to the magic side of the MCU, new plots and characters are introduced.Generic tropes in full force: bad guy knife hand served no purpose other than to further the plot. If he had a name, it didn't matter. He's in the movie a lot and supposedly commands something but it's never explained or the audience isn't supposed to care, which baffles me about the amount of screen time that character was given. A few characters were washed and repeated. The guy on the bus live streaming and narrating has been in a lot of marvel movies. He was Peter Parker's friend in Spider-Man. Except that movie was actually funny.All the funny parts were forced and fell flat for me. I didn't chuckle once. Quirky dialogue can be hit or miss and I felt like this movie was outdated when it came to dialogue; when the producers probably spent the most time re writing that side of the script. It didn't work.But I just say Shang was phenominal. I would love to see him come back. Awkwafina ... felt miscast. I think she did what she could with the role, but I also felt it was meant for a bubbly character and she played it like a guy's girl aka ""one of the guys"". It took me a while to realize awkwafina was not the sister.A lot of unanswered questions like why were the jade pendants so important if they didn't do anything once stolen/recovered? Why didn't the siblings want their lifelong heirlooms from a dead parent back once United with their father? Also the action sets were super confusing. Scaffolding on a building over 50 floors high, or more? A secret map that both pursing parties find quite easily? That throwaway thespian and his winged squishy contributed what to the story?This did not feel like a Marvel movie, and that's fine. But it hardly had any emotional investment for all those long-standing slow motion shots.A forgettable origin story with bland characters and no discernible antagonist."
"Maybe there are just too many super hero movies now, but I found it boring. Some visual aspects were good and it had an ok story, but just didn't find it as good as hoped for a ""new"" marvel take. The main actor seems more appropriate for a b flick too. He's new so maybe he'll grow."
"For the first time, the fight with two people was so amazing, but the farther, the more boring. Too many characters and effects have made the movie a mess and not very real."
Incredible special effects. Incredible action sequences that stand out in the MCU. Incredible back story to Shang-Chi. Everything is incredible until Katy starts talking. There was no need for her character. She wasn't funny. If this movie didn't have her it would've been one of the top 10 MCU movies ever made. Everything good about the movie barely makes up for how much her character sucks.
"I wept internally for 2 hours and 12 minutes that I had to spend watching this utter fiasco and abomination interwoven with Chinese propaganda. If you are entertained with ""cool"" karate kicks, ""jokes"" that make you turn away from the screen in embarrassment and agony mashed with ridicule for western culture and and are eager to welcome your new despotic Chinese capitalist overlords, my god you will be thrilled."
Talented brilliant incredible amazing show stopping spectacular.
The movie is not well written. The story is below average and the action scenes also not very engaging. Wait for it to come on streaming.
"Some of the action and fight scenes are eye candy but the movie is generic and boring. Every cliche from a kung fu/ fantasy movie is there, including flying dragons. Skip this one at all costs."
"Loved the movie all the way though, but i am more interested in spider man movie <3."
The best start for a new phase in MCU. Keep it coming....can't wait to see the next chapter !!!
"If you rarely are disappointed with Marvel films, and you consider yourself a big fan of them, then you will most likely enjoy this film. It's certainly better than a few of the last installments (by a small margin), but this film is proof to all others that there really aren't any fresh ideas anymore, and the Marvel antics are getting rather boring.You have good guy who is lackluster in personality, has some family issues, turns out he's a very important guy in the world, has some impressive abilities which he hones, discovers things about himself, has someone close to him betray him, has to make some big decisions, engages in climactic fight, the end.These movies are so cookie-cutter, all Marvel is now, is predictable pomp and circumstance with flashy lights and SOME, not many, redeeming qualities. Let's start with those first:Choreography. There are some slick-nasty moves in most of the fight scenes. Action scenes, and entertaining fights is certainly one thing Marvel rarely disappoints.Humor. Another typical trait of a Marvel film, you get some good chuckles here and there. However without Awkwafina, this trait would be almost non-existent. And this is coming from someone who usually doesn't care for the smarky humor of the latest generations. But she is rather funny without being TOO annoying and sarcastic.Special effects and cinematography. Solid work, obviously they didn't downsize their SFX department. But compared to the bar set by previous movies in the Marvel world, it's not all that impressive.On to the unflattering traits:Story. WOOF. Predictable through and through, don't expect much of anything here. They could easily have held a writing competition at any average middle school for the students to write a basic action movie script, and the storyline for this film would have probably been the entry from the kid who won 3rd place.Characters. Aside from a a select few, the characters are as flat as a pancake in a hydraulic press.The humor and the action. While I mentioned this earlier as a pro, over time, it all got old towards the end. The attempts at humor starting falling short of the goal, and the action became stale.It's about time to wrap up this dynasty of Marvel movies and move onto something else before it starts to smell like discarded scraps of reused ideas, and accumulate maggots of banality."
I really really loved the movie it was so cool I don't like marvel that much but this movie was bazzar gooooood job Marvel.
"Great movie, and one of my favourite MCU movies (just behind Thor Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy Volume one). Amazing cast, fresh story, and out of this world CGI! Highly suggest you see it in a theatre, for the full experience!The loss of the one star is because as an Asian martial arts movie, it doesn't entirely live up to the greats that have come before it (Crouching Tiger, Hero, etc). Saying it is close though, is praise enough!Very excited this group is part of the MCU, excited to see more!"
"Just like Loki in the Loki series, Shang-Chi isn't even the star of his own show. This is no way an 8.0 movie."
"The action scenes are cool, Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley were funny, and there's some great CGI. Everything else about the movie was mediocre, at best."
This movie was amazing if you have not seen it i highly recamend you see it.
This marvel movie was the most disappointed movie I ever seen.
"From the trailer, I initially thought it was gonna be nothing special or interesting. I was definitely proven right. All the hype on Twitter was what convinced me to watch it but I should probably stay away from Twitter. CGI was alright but the characters were a let down. I mean it started off fine but I almost fell asleep halfway through the film. Though, I have a slight feeling though that some people who rated this 10 and called it the best marvel movie ever haven't seen it.. anyways, this was a 3 and I'm being generous."
This is my Black Panther.Ps. So Lil Nas X exists in the MCUps 2 . Captain Marvel actually looked pretty and had kind of personality in the short appearance !!
"One of the best marvel movies so far we really need part tow, I really liked the characters and they was written so well."
"Seriusly !I didn't even expected much from this movie.I lost intrest in MCU after END-GAME , I only watch phase-4 MCU just for the sake of continuation , but not whole-heartedly.But when i saw this kickass movie , goosebumps ! Lit üî•
No words !The Music killed ! The melody of XU it's still in my ears ..
The fight coreography is new , and spontaneous.The guy , Simu - Lui perfectly synced in the Shang-Chi roleAbsolute blastEvery age group ,irrespective of sex,caste,creed can enjoy this film !"
"Watched Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings with Simu Liu(Kim's Convenience) as Xu Shang-Chi/Shaun,Awkwafina(Crazy Rich Asians) as Katy ,Meng'er Zhang(The Street Dawn) as Xu Xialing,Michelle Yeoh(Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon) as Ying Nan, Florian Munteanu(Creed II) as Razor Fist ,Fala Chen(The Informer) as Ying Li,Benedict Wong(Avengers:Endgame) as Wong And Tony Leung(In The Mood For Love) as Wenwu/The Mandarin.The Film is great if any of you are a fan of Martial Arts you are going to enjoy this also really dives into the spirituality of eastern mythos of the MCU while still have ties to the MCU Wenwu was responsible for the Ten Rings in the Iron Man films going back to the very beginning also love the father dynamic between Shang and The Mandarin great performances from Liu and Leung as well also Awkwafina continues to be on a role since Breaking out in Crazy Rich Asians and also starring in similar film in Raya And The Last Dragon This Is a Game changer also if your A Fan Forbidden Kingdom your are going love this ,This is Game Changer much like Doctor Strange in 2016. Im also grateful its helping Cinema return to form but im not against Hybrid releases though they help in certain areas also they both can Co-Exist.Score By Joel P. West(Just Mercy) ,Cinematography by William Pope(Alita:Battle Angel) and Direction by Destin Daniel Cretton(Short Term 12) A Game Changer also its More Martial Arts Than Superhero 9/10."
"This movie blew me away as I had recently watched Black Widow and was thuroughly disappointed as the movie left much to be desired. I understand that the movie was rushed and was planned to come out during 2020 but it still felt like a disappointment. Anyways, this isn't about black widow. This movie blew me away with great CGI and AMAZING acting. The comedy relief of Katy and Trevor was great to see because it combined with the action perfectly. The actors were great, the fighting was great and looked like a dancers life work and practice, the storyline was PERFECT and the character and wolrd building was on point.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, PLEASE WATCH!TL:DR
Black widow sucks and this movie was great in every aspect."
"And what a gem he is. He took this movie from a 8/10 to a 10/10. He not only serves as comic relief, he is the heart of the movie as well."
The movie was predictable in many ways. A few twists and callbacks to MCU. It was great if you just play along.
"I liked the characters, fight scenes, acting,music, and costumes. The story was predictable and half of the cgi looked cheap though."
"Having fighters who can act there. As really a movie that Asian Americans can be proud of. Adding humor, adventure, depth, and humanity all rolled up on in oneShaun who's Chinese name is Shan Chi and his best friend, Katy work as park valets. Not knowing that their lives will take on more meaning besides dead end jobs.Shaun tries to not have his past be in public even with his best friend there. As he is not proud of it and tries to move on.And that after a bus incident that Katy does not know Shaun is the title character and he reveals his past via note from his estranged sister. Or is it from her. His sister, Xu who runs a fighting and nightclub mixed in one in China.As their childhoods went in different directions due to their father favoring Shaun over his sister there. Is part of it. But the three main character realize that something bigger than they are as the ten rings reveal their destiny not just Shaun's.Not just you will see how Shaun and Xu's mother died but also that why his own father favored him and in the end was very disappointed in him in not keeping a promise there. Leading to Shaun trying to eschew his past.Simu Liu makes a handsome action star who can also act. Awkwafina brings comic relief and finds out that she has something much more to offerSupport by Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung as Shaun and Xu's father and the main antagonist of the film. The latter has his own reasons despite being the villain but with depth and humanity a bit. You do not want to dislike him."
"I don't know who Awkafina is but I found her voice irritating and her role is annoying like a furry toy in a Disney film, that said the rest of the film is kick ass and I was totally engrossed in it."
"This movie really surprised me. Def one of my favorite marvel movies ever, it's worth a watch."
"Shang-Chi is a great character with a compelling backstory. I look forward to seeing him in future MCU movies. There's a lot of fun in this movie, with a nice variety of well-choreographed action.However, I have to dock a star for the way they gave up on Xu Wenwu's character development in the middle of the film. Here's a character with centuries of blood and conquest who gives this up voluntarily to become a family man. This is important both as a personal narrative, as well as for institutional parallels. Even after the death of his wife, he uses the opportunity to teach Shang-Chi about the importance of a blood debt, and then cools back to ""family man"". After his ""family man"" persona is established, his character moves mechanically and in uninteresting fashion as a plot device to further Shang-Chi's character.Docking another star for excessive use of comedic interruption. Plenty of the side dialogue was quite fun, but too often the tension in action scenes was cut unnecessarily for comedic relief that really wasn't that good. With so much casual death, the humor should be dark if at all.Docking one more star for the contrived motivations for fights. Halfway through we find out that Wenwu had no expectation of killing his children when sending his goons, yet he wasted the resources anyway because it was fun for us to watch. Then Wenwu decides to burn the village where his wife is being kept without any real deliberation or dialogue. Sure it was a fun fight to watch, but it largely could've been ignored. We also burned plenty of CGI getting these animals to fight, pretty much just because it looks cool.Lastly, Shang-Chi admits to killing his mother's killer, but we never see the actual scene. Looking forward to when that is finally shown, either in the extended cut release, or in a later film."
Best superhero movie ever made. Shang Chi was epic on every level.
"Watched this today and really enjoyed it! Recommend seeing it. Without saying too much, as a woman and mom, the real hero was the sister. And even my husband in the end thought the heroism would be shared, rings n all, but nope. That was disappointing."
"Shang - Chi had some great elements. The Martial Arts, Choreography, and a few Easter eggs. The bad is when their is forced humor in a serious moment.The few best details was the characters you were familiar with in the other MCU movies. Wong, Abomination, and Trevor the fake Mandarin from Iron Man 3. I love these great surprises.The Martial Arts were also great. It felt more of a Rush Hour and Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon feel to it.The movie had a family element to it. Tragic for Shang-Chi but when things get serious, and why does the studio want forced humor? We do not need Karaoke. But they make it a joke.In the end, I enjoyed it but I don't think it the best MCU movie ever compare to Avengers Infinity War and Endgame."
Good entertaining and Bollywood like. It is loaded with action. Preferably watch on the biggest screen available.
"I'd like to write an in depth review but I feel like there's not enough to these movies for that. They just feel like everything else.If you've seen one of these movies recently you have an idea of what you're in for. If you're into that you'll enjoy it, if you're burnt out on movies feeling the same and characters sounding the same and acting the same and being very the same it will be just another Disney movie in 2021 to kill 2 hours with and get nothing out of.I've been watching Chinese action stars since I was a child. I'm aware of the main actors comments about not being aware of Chinese heroes before himself somehow because he's done zero research and doesn't enjoy classic cinema in his own time.... and is a 2021 person and wants to just say things, virtue signaling I believe it's called.. but I'd recommend he check some of those movies out instead as they're much more interesting."
"The first 1/2 is fantastic, it's right up there with the best of the MCU, I feared the action would follow suit with previous marvel films with nothing but quick cuts and shaky cam but it doesn't and it's brilliant. Cast are fantastic Tony Leung the high point for me. At this point to me the film was an easy 8/10Unfortunately, the second half isn't as tight, the story becomes a little too fantastical ending in a god awful CGI mess that has become all too common with the MCU bringing the score down.It's a shame as the first half is generally fantastic, but I don't see myself rushing to see it again now."
"Good action, great visuals but slow story and weak villian."
"The friend was annoying and unimportant to the story altogether. Her supportive scenes could've been substituted with the sister, and her comedic scenes with the old Mandarin.The villain at the end was barely explained and described as overly powerful... but why? Should've went smaller scale for an origin story."
"Visually it's good, story is bad and very very predictable. Fight scenes, well old hongkong, Chinese style Kung fu fight, pretty much cliche though. Starting Bus fight was little bit of good. Acting is just above average, editing is horrible. Have few below average comedy( p.j.) . In short I don't like it."
Uninspired CGI visuals with horrendously paced over the top insane plot.
"I was actually borderline giving this a 7 out of 10 but can't quite bring myself to do it because the middle is so booooooring!I did however, on the whole really enjoy this but I did think that it was more about the whole cast rather than an origin story of Shang-Chi because an awful lot of attention seems to be given his sister and his friend Katy which seemed odd to me?But sort of odd in a good way because they managed to flesh the characters out enough to make them seem like 'characters' rather than expendable supporting cast.The first third of the movie was for me, the strongest and seeing the full fight scene on the bus shown in the trailer made me appreciate the choreography that went into this. The final third was fine... I wasn't bored... The middle though? Nah :(I preferred this to Black Widow because it's part of the new phase and not some remnant carry over and just felt fresh!There's also some fairly ok humour in there (a lot which misses the mark too though)... yeah, it was good, you should go see it if you like the MCU."
"This movie is something different to movies with action im the MCU like Iron Man and Captain America, Shang Chi connects with the public so quickly, Simu Liu is so funny and his character is so emotional.Katy... wow, what i can't say about her... along with Luis in Antman's movies, Katy is the perfect partner for Shang Chi at the beginning you think is the classic character that you just see 15 minutes and never return, Katy was actually glued with Shang Chi all the movie and her acting was so perfect, that i couldn't handle my laugh, if you like the action movies based on Bruce Lee's classic movies and Kill Bill movies, this is your movie, if you don't like the marvel movies it doesn't matter."
Marvel Studios apparently doesnt learn from its mistakes while they are profitable and makes another movie with tons of jokes instead of focussing on character development.
"Wow, I am so underwhelmed with this movie. I can't be bothered writing a review. This movie is boring, the characters such, the actors are uncharismatic.Disney has done it again! They are experts in dull, uninspiring, talentless garbage woke BS. Yay!"
If this is considered a good Marvel movie then Marvel is in big trouble. Completely unoriginal.
"As a marvel fan my biggest criticism of the mcu is it's lack of extreme violence, however I think the family friendly nature of this film worked really well and was perfect for the style of the film. The action sequences were brilliant and I love how much thought and research was gone into them. The characters were great too and I actively liked all of them. However, this film felt less like a marvel film and more of a Disney film (Less so in the beginning of the film but towards the end I felt like I was watching a fantasy film). The whole final fight scene just felt so Disney and in all honesty it bumped my opinion a lot which was disappointing because I enjoyed the beginning so much. The cast have great chemistry together and there was some great acting, however the fantasy elements weren't to my particular taste. If you like fantasy then I'm sure this will be a top 5 mcu film for you, if not, I doubt it will be in your top 15."
"To start, Shang Chi is a film worth going to see. If you're a Marvel fan it'll be a film that you'll enjoy; story, links to the wider MCU, action, comedy, and visuals. Just take a look at the reviews on here and you get the idea that it's a v good MCU film, that is slightly different from others that we've seen.I thought to add a few things not mentioned in the reviews on here that struck me while I was watching;
a. The slow motion and music/sound during the slow Mo. Something I've noticed about Chinese cinema over the past 2 decades is the over use of slow Mo to try and be poignant or emotional. It's been overdone, especially with the slightly cheesey background music to labour the point. ShangChi leans heavily on these several times and I found myself rolling my eyes more than once. Admittedly you may not notice it.B. The CGI. I thought it wasn't great, particularly at the start in the forest fight and the bus scene. It got better though, and overall the climactic fight was well rendered, if a little disorientating.C. The 'eastern' mystical stuff. They tried to shoehorn in a couple of things but honestly it's kinda like an impression that a westerner would have about 'Eastern history and culture'. It reminded me a little bit of what Marvel did with The Ancient One (a Caucasian lady in Asian clothes), and the way Danny Rand tried to spout a few mystical phrases in Iron Fist.D. Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Yuen Wah. Three major players in Chinese cinema going all the way back to the 80s (I think)... It was great to see them here, particularly Tony Leung who has some of the most expressive eyes in film (I know it's a weird thing to say, but he has) and Yuen Wah who was a classmate of Jackie Chan. I would have liked to have seen more of the latter to be honest and would recommend you check him, Jackie, Sammo Hung and Yuan Biao out on YouTube.E. The fight scenes. Overall they were very good, particularly the hand to hand on the bus (before the CGI). That one was sharp, aggressive and brilliantly choreographed. The one in the forest though!!! It's was one of that have been overdone in Chinese cinema, so an eye roller for me... ie a relationship developing as a result of a fight.F. The humour was great imo and the delivery was great overall.Like I said above it's worth seeing and you'll probably enjoy it. My girlfriend (who's not watch a whole lot of Asian cinema) did. I've seen a fair share of it, from the Shaw Brothers films up to modern day, so somethings did grate on me. Did I enjoy it though? Overall, yes."
"This film is only great of its visual, just like any other marvel films. Plot and the actors are boring, even the Marvel miniseries were way better than this crap. All the high ratings are most probably done by asians!! They just want their asian faces to be highly rated. Even the lead actor were pushing Marvel to do an asian superhero, my questions is why only the chinese, korean, japanese are considered as asians? Why cant be the indians, indonesians, mongolian or country like Kuwait and others be main lead as asians?"
"The fight scenes are lit. I got that adrenaline feeling you get from watching films like John Wick for about 70% of this film. The choreography was very impressive and it gave me a crouching tiger, hidden dragon kinda vibe at times (watch the movie and you'll know what I mean).As far as the story, it sets up the next chapter of the MCU very nicely. That's all I will say #nospoilers."
"I expected glorious fight scenes and the always awesome Awkwafina. But, wow, this movie delivered sooo much more. Loved it. #chickenpig."
"I can begin to describe how awesome this movie was. Welcome to the Marvel universe Shang-Chi, this is one movie that is action packed, funny and great story and character build up."
This movie felt more Disney than Marvel. I enjoyed it but felt the CGI and second part of the movie let it down. The fight scenes in the first half of the film were excellent and then it got silly in the second part. Maybe worth waiting for it to appear on Disney + or DVD.
***spoilers*****I liked how they brought back the fake mandarin character. The dragons were really cool but wish they would have went more in depth about them. Also if it has been thousands of years of protecting that wall why didn't they build defenses around it or a walk way that wraps around the mountain. Just little details I noticed. Overall I thought it was a good movie and had a good story to it.
"Kind of boring film. The premise is interesting, but kind of comedic all over and with little compromise with being convincing. I mean, Marvel films have this requirement for suspension of disbelief by default, but this film kind of explains very little and the character's interaction is shallow and not very meaningful. The end is predictable, everything looks artificial.Perhaps we are all vaccinated against Marvel's all over the place magic to a point that everything looks familiar, boring and flat. Or perhaps the film is just not that great.My big problem with this film is the bus sequence at the start. It eeps going downhill. I mean.. if you can make turns with the bus, why does it keep going down all the time? Turn left twice, it will go uphill instead of downhill and decelerate, then turn to any side and it should come to a standstill. Not very clever, guys."
Brilliant & Beautiful Movie.. Best action scenes.. Best Super Hero Movie of the Year.. Good Tail End.. Loved it..
"The cast, the costumes, the setting! To me, in my opinion (despite the few plot holes here and there) was already detailed enough. The action sequence was good. And the CGI, wow! You should see it for yourself when you get to watch that part. I rather be careful reviewing this because I don't really want to give away any spoilers. So forgive me if I wouldn't put much detail. I can only say that I went to the cinema not expecting so much, but in the end, I actually enjoyed it! So I recommend to give this movie a chance and watch it!"
So so boring movie didn't expect this from Marvel....so much annoying movie.
"FINALLY! A movie that celebrates Chinese heritage and contributions, and doesn't look down on all the beautiful art, culture, music and everything else this fine continent has produced. Everything about this movie was phenomenal. The special effects were obviously mind blowing, but the acting was the absolute best part. I never saw a comic book movie with this much powerhouse performances. They all did so good, I will see this movie again and again. I can't wait for sequels! Also so proud of Simi Liu for breaking all the stereotypes and painting the most gorgeous picture of Chinese life, and everything it can be. Such a riveting story from start to end. LOVEDDDDDD it."
"This is just a bow to China from Marvel, and that's it, half the movie is just daddy issues and forced racial jokes the other half is chinese mythology and tribute to kung fu movies... only a cameo and an after credit scene ""connects"" the Shaun dufe and whatever the hell thosw rings are to the MCU, loosely..."
"Rotten Tomatoes makes it seem like it's on same level with Spider-Man 2 or The Dark Knight, but it's not even close to same level. It's most basic mcu origin story possible. What's the point of these scores when one movie is masterpiece (Spider-Man 2) and another is super mediocre (Shang-Schi), but both have same rotten tomatoes score. It makes no sense."
"This movie makes Black Widow look like an Oscar winning screenplay.The story is just SOOOO bad. There's way too much raw exposition about past events. It feels like half the movie is spent recounting the past in stale narrative exposition. When this much backstory is needed, then you're trying to pack too much into a single film.Character motivations are unclear. Shang Chi's behavior is inexplicable at times, and his sidekick's behavior is similarly confusing. The movie opens with the two of them in low paying jobs, yet somehow they are jet-set world travelers at the drop of a hat. Shang continually puts his friend in life-threatening danger.The movie is weakened by fan service. The callback to Iron Man 3 makes zero sense. Casting Ben Kingsley for comedic relief does nothing for the story.This movie all but breaks the MCU's continuity and overarching story. It introduces new dimensions, races and powers without regard for existing storylines.Cameos don't help. Kingsley's Trevor Slattery feels about 10 years too late and most of his previous story arc from ""Iron Man 3"" and ""Hail to the King"" is negated and/or ignored. Wong is used as comic relief, but doesn't help much more than that.There's nothing fresh in this movie, just Disney trying to cash in on an inferior product."
"I feel all the high reviews are paid....
The story has so many loopholes. Shang's chi father has a chopper. He can use them to reach the village. Why wait for the path to open."
It doesnt feel like a MARVEL movie at all!! Didnt like the movie... Felt like watching Fantastic Beasts and where to find them!! Boring Storyline.
"The martial arts in the movie were amazing and so fun to watch. The plot was decent and flowed nicely. I felt like it was a little long and also I didn't feel like it was connected to the MCU. I supposed it'll all come together at some point because as we know Marvel never misses a beat. My biggest criticism was the acting, especially from Awkwafina. Her acting is awful. Overacting throughout the entire movie. I didn't find her funny at all, although she was placed in the movie as comic relief. Totally flopped. And of course, she has to be the character that has no fighting experience whatsoever but ends up helping save the day. Ridiculous. Overall a good movie but not in Marvel's top 10."
"Movie started out solid but just got more predictable and mediocre as it went a long. The acting was good and the visuals were great but the story is essentially the same cookie cutter we have seen a million times.It really feels like Marvel is 0/2 Post end game with this and black widow.The other thing that forces the score down for me is Bri Larson's insignificant cameo (she just is not good for her role and has zero charisma! And the forced ""Girl Power"" moments. What ever happened to just showing strong female characters without having to ""tell"" the audience...It has now become the eye roll moment of marvel movies.Would not recommend paying to see this and would wait for it to come to Disney Plus."
"Rotten Tomatoes makes it seem like it's on same level with Spider-Man 2 or The Dark Knight, but it's not even close to same level. It's most basic mcu origin story possible. What's the point of these scores when one movie is masterpiece (Spider-Man 2) and another is super mediocre (Shang-Schi), but both have same rotten tomatoes score. It makes no sense."
"Too much good movie in pandemic, surprise for all movie lovers."
"This is yet another film that I appreciate more than I actually like it. I'm really glad this movie exists and we have more diverse characters in the MCU. The Film nails Shang-Chi. Simu Liu gives a great performance and while his motivation isn't exactly clear, his character is and I like that. It's good to see that the origin movie does a great job at giving us a somewhat compelling character that I am looking forward to seeing more of. However, all of the other characters aren't anywhere close to being as good. The performances from most everyone is good with Tony Leung giving a great performance. His villain isn't great character wise but what I really adored was his villain's motivation. We finally get a true villain who is motivated by grief and the inability to accept the loss of a loved one. I love that about him and it's refreshing to see that. The story here is very weak. I didn't engage with it that much and it was hard to understand the motivations of anyone except the villain. The plot progresses quickly but it's hard to remember individual story beats because it kinda melds into some of the other MCU films. One thing that does stand out are the visuals and some of the action sequences. Some of the action sequences here were great like the final battle while others felt lackluster. It's a mixed bag in regards to that. As always, the visuals for this film are great for the most part. There is the occasional weird visual effect but it doesn't get absolutely horrible. The production design was surprisingly great here. All of the sets look really cool and it's obvious they spent a lot of time on that. There really isn't a lot more to say. On one hand, there are a lot if great things here but in the other, it feels like a standard Marvel movie. I would recommend checking it out if you are still into the MCU."
"The storyline was alright, the acting was alright. Would've given it 6/10 but Leung's acting was what added one more point for me. The character was probably too simple for Leung (I've watched his movie growing up), but he really added a lot of depth to the role. Unexpected chemistry between Katy and shang chi? Or are they just friends? I can't tell."
It is one of the best movies that Marvel Studios could have made.I hope they make the sequel a lot better!
"Shang-chi review : spectacular visual wonder
My rating : 8.5/10
Cast & performances :
The film has Simu Liu in top form. He is your ordinary guy but extraordinary powers and actor blends into the character well - with not a single false note. Giving him good company are actresses Awkwafina who is effortless in whatever she does and Meng'er Zhang who also performs some mind-numbing stunts.The star of the film of course is veteran actor Tony Leung- a father who wants to bring back his family together but also is aware of his extraordinary powers. It's his love for his dead wife that makes him tough and cold towards his children. Years back Leung had charmed the world with his subtle style in Wong Kar Wai's 'In The Mood For Love'. Decades later, Leung has aged like fine wine and it's a delight to watch him play the antagonist with such style.Ben Kingsley and Michelle Yeoh too make their presence felt in the limited screen time they have.Technical values :
Shang-Chi scores high on its technical front. Each and every craft excels in giving a thoroughly enjoyable superhero action flick. The top-class VFX take the audience into a world of mythical adventure. The cinematography, production design and background score are top-notch.Shang-Chi, directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, attempts to shake up the Marvel formula by infusing it with martial-arts action and fairy-tale fantasy and grounding it in Chinese and Asian American culture. And while its disparate elements don't meld together as smoothly as they should, they do, in the end, add up to a superhero movie fresh and fun enough to feel worth a spin"".Shang Chi's strength lies in balancing itself. For every high octane action sequence, there's a back story to get you readjusted to your seat. The amazingly choreographed fights will bring you to the edge of your seats and at the same time, you can't help but groove to the peppy background score. There are so many good songs on their list.Apart from music, Marvel once again excels in terms of CGI. The graphics are so compelling that you don't regret stepping inside a cinema hall in times of a pandemic. They're worth it.Highlights :
Cast & Brilliant performances
Stunning top notch visual effects
Extraordinary High Octane Action Stunts
Fantastic Cinematography
Terrific Background Score
Good story and DirectionOverall : Adventurous ride into a mythical world."
"I don't know that much about Marvel movies but this Great terrible thing wow really. I love it
One of the best Marvel movies without a doubt."
"A good start to the fourth phase, not counting the black widow."
"It was ok. Nothing new, but that's what Marvel does, churns out the same story over an over."
"It's a story about love, have courage to respond to your calling, and letting go. Great acting and the whole package of the whole movie is awesomely done. Though I don't think the marketing of the film is good, for almost zero campaign regarding this film is seen prior it debute. Another thing worth mention is Chinese people just won't fight or even threaten to ""kill"" his/her parent, not to mention to even fight in front of parent's tomb. Marvel could have avoid the fighting thing in the shrine, since Chinese culture just won't allow anything disrespectful the ancestors at all.The story line of wenwu(Tony Leung), his character and his love towards his son and daughter is obvious, and Leung did a great job acting as a Chinese stubborn strict father who's afraid his legacy will be lost and desperately want to build an empire to conquer all. He loved his son and let his son do whatever he wanted for ten years. And though he had it all, wenwu realized he can never get over his wife and he wanted to see her so badly, he became delusional and knowing it's not possible but still wanted to break the gate in Talo.The story of why Webwu is like this is solid. But shangchi wise, is not. The movie would be better if shangchi showed a bit of affection towards wenwu and his sister. Also, in ancient Chinese society, women often has to learn to play music, sewing, or painting and play chess. Shangchi's sister could have done other stuff, rather than peeping aside and not being able to learn anything in her childhood, since Wenwu supposed to love her as well. In regards of wenwu's power and money, it shouldn't be hard to find his offsprings proper tutor.CGI wise is intriguing, you will see some characters from ancient Chinese Shan hai jing. It pretty much like Jurassic park in Marvel universe.Btw, we need more Tony Leung in Hollywood."
"Form the moment I sat into theatre I was lost in shang chi's worlds. Movie doesn't rely heavily on jokes which is a big relief cause marvel movies nowadays rely too much on jokes they stuff joked in emotional scenes too. Like they played Thor's depression for jokes, Thor meeting his dead mother after a long time was also foreshadowed by jokes. Jokes occupy most of newer marvel movies even endgame falls victim to this. But this movie is different there are joked but they are placed well. Characters won't joke between fights or between emotional heavy hitting scenes and boy the action in this movie its captivating to say the least. The dynamic between Shang chi and his father is awesome. You sympathize with both Shang chi and his father. Marvel feels like old school marvel this time. Its his origin story not many character pop from other flicks and even when they do they don't take much spotlight. Definitely watching it another time....."
I really lovelovelove kungfu action movies n I reallyreally enjoyed this movie tremendously! I wud love to see Shang-Chi 2 34567.
"The current MCU effort is truly a slight one as it swings for the fences to do what Black Panther did for all inclusive audiences by presenting an African superhero now we have a candidate, of the Asian persuasion, hoping for a repeat. Filling in the backstory of the rings (first introduced way back in the first Iron Man) which star Tony Leung has wielded for about 1000 years, which are a means of gaining power but when Leung wants to conquer a revered village in a remote forest, he meets his match & love which quells his desire to dominate fathering a pair of offspring (a boy & girl) as icing on the cake. Years later we find the scion, now played Simu Liu, living in the States working as a valet attendant w/his best friend, played by Awkwafina. When on a bus ride some men accost Lung for his jade pendant, his fighting prowess presents itself & fearing his sister is in similar straits (a cryptic postcard he received from her makes him think so), off he goes back to the bosom of Leung's fortress where he reveals their long dead mother may still be alive being held captive by the same residents of the Shangri-La he wanted to subjugate years before setting up a massive battle between Leung's forces & benevolent group of villagers who know the voice of Leung's wife is actually a captive dragon trickster hoping to be unleashed in order to feed on the souls of the nearby populace. So far so good, right? Wrong. Why did the usual craft & polish Disney's output come up short here? Lackluster lead, check, hackneyed story w/vague intimations of Asian legends & so forth, check (they do realize this comic book character was created by a couple of white guys!) & a third act replete w/motion & color to entice the viewers into thinking something more important is going on when the truth is, it isn't, check again. Didn't Disney fail to realize this was to be their third Asian inflected release in a year (after the live action Mulan remake & Raya & the Last Dragon animated feature, which also featured Awkwafina's vocal talents) so some of the story-lines would begin to cross pollinate & dilute each other until the final result would look like so much of a hodgepodge? I hate to be the dissenting opinion here but I would've rather have seen a big screen treatment of Iron Fist over this, apologies. Also starring Benedict Wong reprising his Wong character, Yuen Wah from Kung Fu Hustle as an archery elder, Michelle Yeoh as Liu's aunt & Zach Cherry (in his second incarnation in the MCU, he played the hot dog vendor who dares Spider-man to flip in Homecoming) here playing a bus passenger."
"I can't understand why people are rating this 10 /10, it's ok, good special effects and fight scene's but story and the supposed laughs just didn't work for me, go and see free guy for a 10 /10 film."
"This film was outstanding! I loved the backstory of Shang-Chi, possibly one of the MCU's best yet, it was very cultural, I loved how they spoke in mandarin or whatever it's called half the time, the CGI was incredibly top notch and the cast was simply superb - Simu, Tony and Fala etc all did an awesome job, but my favourite was definitely Awkwafina! It was also such a pleasure to see Benedict Wong again and some more familiar faces - all in all, absolutely amazing, can't wait to see what's next!"
"I don't know why people giving bad reviews but this movie is a good one to watch the CGI, bgm, action there slots of plus points in the movie the ending 30 min is a rampage. Don't fell for negative reviews enjoy it with family and friends."
Shang-Chi was AMAZING!!!! One of my TOP FAVORITE Marvel movies! I cannot wait to see this again (and again)!!!The fighting was beyond superb. The depth of acting was heartfelt and was the living embodiment of the movie. Simply the best Marvel origin story to date. Well done!
"This movie was very disappointing. It was very poorly made and did not seem to be thought out at all. Which is why I was bewildered to find that this movie was so widely liked by the mcu fanbase, and was saddened to find even some of my friends liked the movie. I've seen this film be praised for its good characters, humor, fight scenes and storytelling. But I strongly disagree with almost all praise for this movie. I will admit there are some things to praise this movie for but whatever they are they are few and far between.This movie had some decent choreography for the fights, about a third of the fights were pleasing to the eye. However I only enjoyed 2 fights and that is only because the lead actor Simu Liu was the main focus of the fights. With Simu Liu background in martial arts he was able to do the fight choreography without the movie resorting to the overly zoomy and shaky camera with 5 cuts per movement that plagues most of the other mc movies. But sadly the rest of the fights are the typical marvel cutty fights or a gross mush of group fights with no discernible stakes.The main character actually had some good moments where I felt like he was a good person and he actually did not cause casualties in the double digits unlike most of the other recent ""heroes"". But he has no personality and all of his decisions make little sense. The bad guy has many of the same problems where they establish his character but then they make him do things against that character. Sadly there were no other characters that could carry them due to the fact that most of the characters in the movie were either soulless things with useless unfunny jokes or characters with exposition to shove down our throats, and only made decisions to move the plot onwards. This saddened me greatly because I rather like a lot of the actors in this movie.There were 2-3 jokes in the whole movie that I found even remotely funny. Besides those all the jokes were bad and lazy, usually ruining the mood of the scene or just carrying on for far too long. But due to the large amount of jokes and the little amount of comedic relief all of the ""funny"" characters seemed tasteless, unfunny and annoying.The story told was not inherently bad, It just had to rely on the hollow dialog to carry it along. And with most of the characters not really being expanded upon they seem to only be vesicles for this bad move to work.in all i did not enjoy watching this movie, i did however enjoy bashing on it with my friends and making fun of my ex-friends for liking it."
"As an Asian I would not like this filmThe choice of character, do they truly represent China or other Asian culture? If a Chinese or other Asian watches this, would they like them just like Americans and Europeans would feel for the character of Iron man or Thor?The Mandarin talk sounds very strange for people who really speak and understand Chinese.I can see it is trying to put in some Asian, or at least Chinese bits in, like the water map, the bamboo...... but it is still unable to achieve what we might think is beautiful, but for Westerns, it's fine to show as this is Asian style."
"Shan-Chi gives a totally different vibe from other mcu movies which has touched me so deeply. It was really very important for phase 4 and shang chi did a really great job!!! I loved this movie...so I gave it 10/10. It has both action and emotion to catch the audience. It surely won't disappoint anyone whether he/she is a marvel fan or not
This was worth of watching."
"Just an 80's kung-fu flick jazzed up for 2021. More reminders of the 'horrible racism"" that exists, because America is the only Country that's had a problem with that...herp derp."
This should be not less than 8.5I am very impressed.
THIS WAS AMAZING I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT AND OH MY GOSH I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS AHHSKDJHSJKJDF10/10 WANTED TO RE-WATCH DIRECTLY AFTER I FINISHED IT.
This is the movie im waiting for. Next level of visual effects in shang-chi.
"After the Mulan remake, it was safe to say that I was thoroughly disappointed, the portrayal of Chinese culture, even in the mystical sense, just felt like a disaster. But this one, oh this one was so much better. I was actually impressed. It felt like it was actually catered to a different market this time. While someone unfamiliar with Chinese culture may find it to be 'just another Marvel movie(albeit an amazing one), to those who know, you will be treated to something that has been basically non existent in Hollywood films, aka inside jokes/depth of knowledge that really helps elevate the film to a whole nother level."
"Top notch cherography and fighting scenes
And winwu is a great character."
"If only marvel gave them more budget, the cgi could be more beautiful than this. The acting, the plot , the action are soooooo beautiful."
"What does the Ironman, Thor, etc. Movie had in common?Some newbie (yet to be famous) guy, and with great animation, action sequences, screenplay, character arcs, some old and established actors, great camera & direction works and at last the happy endings.Same with this one. I liked the movie, a great experience in a long time, post covid.Must watch it in theatre or with family and kids.You would love and enjoy watching it.Marvel is the boss and they have proofed 20+ times."
"Entertaining from the get-go, alluring with an excellent build-up and great choreography that takes you back to the 'Crouching Tiger' era, Shang-Chi adds an interesting dynamic to the MCU.The two main leads are compelling, I loved the comedic timing of Awkwafina and the seamless choreography of the movie, everything flowed easily, and the color palette and cinematography are also compelling arguments here. My favorite scene is a harmonious ""dance"" between two characters that grabbed me to the screen and didn't let go.Overall, if you enjoy Chinese mythology mixed in with the familiarity of the MCU then you are sure to enjoy this origin story, the best one since 'Black Panther', for me at least. It got me hyped about what is coming!Be on the lookout for two after-credits scenes!"
"Shang-Chi is visually spectacular and combats well with the fight choreography, which is the strongest part about the movie. As Marvel's first Asian led superhero movie, it amazingly depicts the story of a young man trying to become someone who is completely different than his father and fits well with the movie's heritage of the mandarin. The introduction of the ten rings bring a bold new perspective of the weapon from the comics and becomes one of the best powers to have in the MCU. It is a standard superhero film as there is a huge CGI battel at the end, but nonetheless done beautifully. After Marvel's mediocre first start of phase 4's Black Widow, marvel once again proves to us they still got it."
This movie has a great storyline and a ton of action pack scenes. I'd watch this movie again but the trailers exposed too much. Overall this was a great movie and deserves 700+ million box office.
"I found this story to be incredibly moving and I absolutely loved the story. My partner and I spent the entire ride home comparing notes and gushing about the acting. Anyone who says ""the acting is ok"" is using that BS to support their overall dislike for the film *or* they've recently changed their meds. I was surprised at how well Awkwafina's character fit into it all. She was an anchor for the main character to the life he ran away to. She had purpose - especially in the end.They all had great character development and I loved the story. The antagonist killed it and he just layers upon layers. The main characters acting was outstanding.I cried through a lot of this film. At several points I asked myself why the hell I was crying so much (wait... did I recently change meds?!). Maybe it's the family loss that hit home. They brought in other characters from the MCU and it was nice seeing so many other movies threaded into this.I'm surprised at anything less than 7 stars. This film was great entertainment and I'll be first in line for the sequel."
"With the natural expectations weighted on this movie, it was quite incredible. Plot was surprising/neat and the fighting was just amazing. I thought it was respectful of Eastern media and really praised a few cultures together. Aquafina also did well to be enjoyable but not annoying. Very well done."
"Let's face it, Shang-chi is pretty much Black Panther with an all Asian cast. I'm sure this sounds rather cynical but here me out: the first half of the film is a down-to-earth James Bond kind of film, then our protagonist reunited with his family halfway through and is transported to a fantasy world, only to have internal family conflicts drive the rest of the plot. Sound familiar? I'm in no way saying the two are parallels but this overarching story arc is becoming cliche. Black Widow was sort of guilty of this in a way, but was still unique in its own right, for better or for worse. In the case of Shang-Chi, the plot was extremely predictable. He would inevitably reunite with his family and battle his father. That didn't strip the film of all suspense, but Marvel screenwriting remains an Achilles heal.Wew! Now that I've got that out of the way, here's everything I loved about this movie: this has the GREATEST fight choreography of any Marvel movie Ever. There was this beautiful, majestic rhythm and flow to every single action scene that at many parts gave me literal goosebumps. For once, the CGI complimented the action beautifully without making me cringe. In a way it was like a remake of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. In addition, the acting was above average for a Marvel movie. The complex motivations of the hero and villain were realistically portrayed. Speaking of the villain, Xu Wenwu deserves a spot next to Thanos and Killmonger as one of Marvel's greatest antagonists. And compare to the snooze-fest that was Black Widow, the plot was flying as fast as a dragon. Finally, the cherry on top, Awkwafina and the hilarious comic-relief she infused into this whole story. Her style was really reminiscent of Guardians of the Galaxy. The film wouldn't have been nearly as entertaining without her.Overall, this definitely exceeded expectations (although they were pretty low after Black Widow). It's a pleasing popcorn movie with enough complexity and artistry to garner some awards. And for Marvel fans, it's clear Shang-Chi's existence in this universe is a game changer."
"People voted 8-10, rly? For what? Story line is primitive and the gaps filled with some martial arts. ""and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" there was no any legend at all, just rings which give some super powers we see them in the begging of the movie and at the end. Producers added Ben Kingsley and Benedict Wong to tailor Shang-Chi to other MCU movies, but it feels so disconnected like Billy Bob Thornton as a Santa in Bad Santa. Michelle Yeoh is playing Crouching Tiger again, it's so SAD that Hollywood does not give her non-kung-fu roles, she has talent for sure.In short, after 1hr I started to check my watch because the whole thing was so boring I just wanted it to end."
"Shang-chi is the basic marvel origin story formula, We as marvel fans kinda know the outline of these films by now. That being said the films best parts was its pacing it flowed really well and kept you as the audience really entertained and engaged in what's going on in the film. The films jokes landed well and the action in this film was better than a lot of the marvel films we have seen lately. The story of the film wasn't bad but wasn't anything super investing the best part of the movie really was the performance of the lead actors who play Shang chi and Katy."
"I was so excited to see this just becos of Tony Leung, and he pulled this off amazingly. He probably the few or actually the only one villian that you love in the MCU. All the casts are good, the sister is a bit soft but ok. Anyways, it's a fun movie, and if you like Tony Leung, you have to see this, this film will make you love Tony even more."
"This is the first movie to see in theaters since Covid-19 and let me tell you something, the movie is visually stunning and I mean the graphics, cinematography, and the colorful nature of Macau. The acting was great and had some heart (better in my opinion than Black widow) especially Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, and Michelle Yoeh. The soundtrack was very good. The film has some morals (something that I like to have in movies) like family and history protection, and the Asian issues in America. At the end, it's a very good movie to see in theaters with family. I give the movie 10/10."
"A movie with clear and crisp visuals that blends Chinese Kung Fu with CGI to perfection, but this seems to come at a cost of a weak and underdeveloped plot with misplaced priorities that prevents the audience from investing into the characters."
"I really had fun with this new Marvel movie, I didn't know who Shang-Chi was but I did my research on the character and went in on what I learned.Simu liu was awesome as Shang-Chi and played the character amazingly, Awkwafina was pretty funny and likable.The fight scenes and stunts were all really well choreographed and really cool seeing.I really liked the villain and the connection to the hero and the final fight. I found it amazing.Another great addition to the MCU."
"The first part of the first act is awkward due to the inclusion of Awkwafina. While i enjoy her in many other roles, her character here is executed poorly. Sometimes the scene calls for her to react with a little more reality, a little more urgency but you can tell she's staring at green tennis ball. This pops up through the rest of the movie.It just didn't hit the emotional marks enough for me to care. The ending fell in to the usual tropes of too much on-screen mayhem.It is gorgeous. The choreography is spectacular. It's still a fun spectacleIt may, like other MCU flicks, grow on me with repeated viewings."
"**What I didn't love**Some decision making by the characters were a little bit off-putting and unclearMotivations likewisePlot, pacing, storyline were a little off in some places (e.g. Shang chi's power progression was a questionable moment for me; bit of an abrupt ending)Theaters are really trying to milk the pre-show value... it was close to 35 minutes dammit**What I liked (Not in a particular order)**Great music. Gonna check out the actual soundtrack (BIBI is on it!!)CG was straight up amazing. In comparison to some recent Marvel movies I watched (cough black widow cough), they really pulled it off on this oneAwkwafina is hilarious. She really carried this movie. Added the lightness that is present in all Marvel moviesRings as a weapon is SUCH an amazing concept. They really visualized it wellMartial arts actions scenes were not as cringe as I expected (except for the one where they fall in love)I really appreciate the growing Asian representation in Hollywood films. They really did a good job making it culturally ""Asian"" but not cringe like... some other examples!Overall, pretty solid Marvel film - I hope to see this franchise grow and evolve as this movie was by far not perfect but really good for a starter;"
"Shang-Chi was a great surprise! Didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. It is ranked high up amongst other Marvel's great blockbusters! Only had good things to say about this film. Great visuals, beautiful landscapes, action-packed scenes as well as the martial arts were the best ever captured on the big screen. The film felt authentic to the Chinese culture and the cast were perfect. The predominantly Asian & Asian-American cast shows an important step forward towards cultural representation in these big budget blockbuster films, and it's nice to not only see Asian characters presented with none of the all-too-common stereotypes. It was also great to see moments that allowed for strong women to have their time to shine without it feeling forced . The comedic moments and timing were spot on and added even more flavour to this great film.A great start to Phase 4. Look forward to seeing these new characters and stories furthered in future Marvel movies."
"This film was beyond what I thought it was. Yeah it has some forced jokes and some pacing problems but these get overshadowed by the rich story , emotions and actions. THE FIRST HALF gives you a good setup and stunning hand to hand fights while the Second half gives Gorgeous Scenes , creatures and Fights . THE dragon fight at end was just wow and the way the rings were used sometimes like spiderman and sometimes an invisible chair is so good . Plus I think it has one of the great post credit scenes. It needs to be enjoyed in the biggest screen possible with 3d."
"To be honest i wasn't much interested to watch this movie even as a marvel fan..but my friends forced me to watch it and now i am guilty ...what was i thinking to be not interested in such a masterpiece?? Even the 1 star reviewers liked this movie,they just dont want to admit it ( in my opinion) .my advice for the poeple who are going to watch it is please make sure that the first time you watch this movie should be in theatres,its just a whole different experience."
"Pros:
Fight scenes
Similar Li and Akwafina had a good connection
Funny
Good cgiCons:
BMW plug
Slow at times."
"I thought the storyline is fine. The Chinese (& unfortunately some Japanese) elements incorporated shows that they did a lot of research, and it didn't feel pandering. The set and the special effects during some fight scenes are absolutely stunning. I also thought the dialogues about remembering your roots and your name not only represents an important pillar of Chinese morals, but a timely message that a lot of immigrants can relate to.However, I think Tony Leung's acting completely stole the show, so much that it completely overshined Shang-Chi's story arc. From start to end, I was way more invested in his performance and his character, while his death felt rushed and left me wanting more. I also thought it's a pity that the sister's story arc got set aside for Awkwafina's, because it could be so important to Shang-Chi's character development.I thought the storytelling at the first half of the story is surprisingly captivating, and I wished the second half didn't lose that element to incorporate more fight scenes. But I enjoyed it overall."
"If I could I'd give it a 7.4 then I would! It had the right amount of comedy mixed with action and a decent storyline. The plot was a little bit predicable, but not overly cliche."
One of the best Marvel's film but in India it should be released in 3D For the best experience otherwise it is a good movie.
"Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Very well made. Full of action, comedy, emotion!"
"I was very impressed with the narrative of this film. Not predictable at all. Amazing fight choreography. Sometimes the action sequences were blurry, which was my only complaint. Great cast. Color grade was pretty good too."
"This movie has been much anticipated, but in my opinion it fell short.Marvel to me is absolute gold (along with the Dark Knight saga).This movie lacked humor (apart from Mr slattery). CGI was way over the top and wire fighting was too obvious. As a kung fu movie, this failed."
"The CGI was great but apart from it everything is just ok at the best, It didn't connect with any character at all. To be honest wait for the film to come on streaming services, not worth it to go to the cinema. The storyline was kind of confusing."
Very Predictable movie. Not that great as the review and ratings shows.
"Marvels new master is shang chi
Best action sequences with best bgm
And best vfx and don't miss the credit scene."
Was excepting something new from Marvel this time around but Shang-Chi still feels like its brought down by the Marvel formula. The action scenes are definitly a strong highlight along with the acting. I like a lot of the camera moves and the dynamic colours and costume design make this movie stand out among the other mcu films. Technically this is a massive achivment but sadly the story does not hold up. As the movie goes on the story gets weaker and weaker until it becomes a giant cgi fest like every other superhero movie ever. There is obviously a lot of heart and talent that went into this project but the mcu is turning 13 years old now and we are still using this same repetitive formula.Shout out to the guy that looked like Morgan Freeman he was the real star of the show.
"This movie does VERY well as a stand-alone movie to just take a step back from the huge marvel universe. Although what also makes it so great is the ties they make to the rest of the marvel universe so it feels like something new but also familiar. Plot was really great, and action scenes were amazing.Great feel and aesthetics overall, really up there with Dr. Strange."
"This is how you take super ability and make it realistic. Nothing was overdone, not even the CGI. They took their time with the story development, yet there was enough tension between the characters to drive the fight scenes... What an amazing intro to some Shang Chi characters; Simu Liu is fantastic and the core of the film really sticks with the audience. This was legit."
I can say with full confidence that this movie had the best action sequences than all the other marvel movies combined. It was really something I never could have expected ever from a movie I know very little about. Would definitely recommend this movie to watch in theatres.
"Not sure what all the hype is about as far as non Asian movie goers are concerned. The movie was ok at best. It has some great fight scenes, ok comedy, and great cinematography,(it's Marvel after all) but over it's kinda dumb. The first part of the movie is pretty good, the second half all the way to the end is pretty ridiculous. I won't give away anything here. My wife is Asian, so I went with her family to see it last night. It was all Asians in the theatre besides a few white people. I asked my sister-in-law why she liked it so much, and her reason was ""because I'm Asian."" That's exactly how Obama became President, and why black panther did well at the box office, because minorities support minorities whether the finished product is good or not. It's rather annoying, and I don't care who gets offended reading this, because it's fact! All the big babies will down vote this, but they know I'm right. Marvel needs to get back to making awesome movies like Thor Ragnarok, and Endgame. The Hulk movies, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, and Shang-Chi ain't it, sorry not sorry."
This is making the future of the MCU look even greater than it is.
"Action sequences are badass, Tony Leung and Simu Liu are terrific, and the film has a lot more emotional weight than I expected. Humor falls a little flat but this is an above-average MCU film."
"Marvel Studios' ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is the latest modern-day extension to the MCU? Guided to craft beautifully by Destin Daniel Cretton. Shang-Chi has a massive soulfulness that future MCU movies need to take notes on and that only Black Panther did so memorably. It occurred to me while watching this movie that it is genuinely no longer about the characters we focus on, but it is their adventure toward locating themselves, and we follow that adventure here in an amazing Superhero Oriental Fantasy blockbuster. Noticeably, the VFX, scene sets, costume designs, and the special effects themselves incredibly heightened the impact of the movie and allowed a symbolic impact on the awe-inspiring production value and, as a result, the aforementioned movie knocked out in dazzling heights on a beautiful scale because of the VFX. The movement sequences and choreography are polished and stunning. Narratively, the storyline continues incredibly, and we understand the moments of humour the MCU is so well-known for, and we are all here for it. This film divided me going to the cinema and waiting for a digital component! Because of COVID-19, however, I didn't need to have the entirety of Shang-Chi spoiled earlier on with leaks, thank goodness I went to the very first showing on the opening Thursday night, I have experienced Shang-Chi several times now and in extraordinarily different formats including 4D-X. This movie displays some of the most remarkably phenomenal combat performances in a Marvel movie I had never seen in this noticeable approach previously. The movie is formulaic and well-trodden territory for Marvel and has several exceptional visual effects layered in. Shang-Chi is such an enchanting movie to watch and even better on the biggest screen you can find, keeping safety in mind at all times! If you have seen Marvel movies consistently, you've got to know that the narrative is a predictable storyline for Marvel's superhero foundation adventures. This film is full of numerous great moments, with its battle sequences and action set pieces, which is arguably undoubtedly its major attraction. But Shang-Chi has given us some outstanding personalities and characters in a live-action film like Black Panther's did so on his solitary quest. Marvel Studios' Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the most exceptional superhero movies I've watched in years, if not in the past decade. Simu Liu and Meng'er Zhang and Tony Leung Chiu Wai get considerable distinct and exceptional choreographed action choreography that we have not witnessed since Captain America: Winter Soldier. There is not any one thing like Shang-Chi I have seen before in the MCU, this film seems fresh. Shang-Chi feeds us with the deprived traditional antique sequences of martial craftsmanship, which we appreciate a lot as an audience and applauds in an incredible modern depiction. This is one of the better, exceptional Marvel films ever. I would recommend watching this one."
"The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres. It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.Awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits.Without stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong's superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers."
"This was great to watch, and up to the middle I was thinking this could be one of the best marvel movies. The action and story was great.The only thing was the ending seemed a bit typical of a lot of not great marvel movies. Just a big fight to draw it all to a conclusion. Guardians, winter soldier and Loki seem totally memorable for the characters more than the epic conclusion.Was a great movie, but marvel have done more interesting."
"I love this movie
The story is unique and the emotion of loosing mother and the fatherhood is very very special well done marvel."
"One of the best Marvel movies I've ever seen, was not expecting for it to be this good but it exceeded expectations far and beyond. Definitely recommend this!"
"The stroy is amazing yes, tho feels like i saw it before. Nothing new here but the bus scene. I was rly exited to see marvel taking another direction but i was wrong.. If the movie had more moments like the bus scene it could have been an easy 10/10 for me but the potentioal was unfortunatly wasted.Then all that CGI crap with that dragon and those rings was aight but like show me crazy fight scenes like the bus scene i just dont understand why every marvel movie as to include cgi. In most cases its great but not in this one, they could have sticked with the fighting formula and it would have been great. Other then that some funny moment but thats all i gotta say on this one."
"I have to say it, Hollywood is pretty honest in this movie and tells it as it is: As a woman, you can be badass and tough and strong - but you will always play the second fiddle. It's outraging. Although the plot was a mess and this movie was all over the place - this was the true message that came across. The mother and the sister were the strongest characters, yet the mother had to give up her powers when she married this horrible man and the daughter - despite being overlooked all her life mustered up the strength and motivation to become a great fighter. Although she was way stronger than her brother, she ended up with nothing, while her brother is now the master of the rings. A real slap in the face of every woman and every girl who is going to watch this movie. Oh, and have I mentioned the awful plot?"
Average movie .I don't know but it felt like a cartoonish fantasy movie .More like kids entertainment.
"Having been starved for a Marvel movie and after the fiasco that was Black Widow, I think many are rating this movie higher than it deserves.A running time of 2hr and 13 min felt more like 2 and a half hrs. Awkwafina, meant to be the comedic sidekick, was completely out of place. She had no skill set, could not speak Chinese and was not particularly funny. I did not like the pacing particularly the numerous flashbacks to the past. Instead of attempting to subvert our expectations by springing surprises on the audience as it relates to a character's character it would have worked better to have a linear timeline. Doc Ock was not shown to be evil out of the box and then through flashbacks is it explained why he is the way he is.Finally, I felt that cinematically you can see similarities between this movie and other martial arts movies released in the early 2000s (Hero, The Forbidden Kingdom) specifically in some fight scenes."
"The problem with this movie is not that was that bad except few scenes , but was too boring - not interesting !"
It was a deluge of OTT. You could miss it and live a totally fulfilling life.
"As a positive thing, I liked the idea of combat without using so many and sophisticated weapons."
"Despite my high expectations, this movie was still better than i thought it would be. The post credit scene blew my mind and the CGI effects are top notch. Woul recommend everyone to watch it‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó"
"First of all, my husband and I love superhero and sci-fi movies. We have seen most, if not all, of them either at home or on the big screen. We love the action, suspense, and thrills most of the movies provide. While this movie was visually appealing, it lacked the momentum that my husband and I are accustomed to from the MCU. Both of us fell asleep during the movie when things became so boring that we couldn't hold our eyes open. Towards the end, when they introduced the ""comedy relief,"" both my husband and I groaned. This movie did not need comedy relief; it needed action and suspense--neither of which appeared until the last 15 minutes of the movie. Compared to the last movie we saw, ""Free Guy,"" this movie fell flat on its face. Don't waste your money going to the theatre to see this; wait until it comes out on free Internet TV."
"The cast, music, choreography and comedic relief started very strong. And then it rushed...
It feels as though the movie is split in two, taking a very different direction halfway, and it didn't do it justice."
It was okFctcyycctctcrcrctuvy ty y y. K h h k j f f i j h ju u h.
This has to be a test. Anyone that is praising this movie either has the intelligence of a 12 year old or is a complete slappie shill. The movie isn't offensively bad but it plays like it was written by a child. Silly and shallow. A far cry from epic Marvel.
"What is the purpose of having Ben Kingsley performing as Mandarin? Ironman Tony Stark is dead. I never liked Mandarin in the Ironman installments since it reminds me of the insulting Chinese evil character Fu Man Chu,so why here in Shang-Chi. The character adds absolutely nothing to the movie plot line nor character development!And Wong allowed to compete in an martial
arts competition? Seruously?"
"The movie as a whole is a decent watch. It has some great ideas and fight scenes, but it all just seems a little shallow, and like the movie is scare of commit to anything so it just ends up falling like none of the great potential ever amounts to any thing.The actor who portrays Shang Chi does a good job, but he unfortunately does not get much depth to work with, he starts and ends his character ark at basically the same spot, he does not really get any moments to express any real emotion.For me there are 3 main problems.1. The sister character is only there to show a female character can be a badass...""we know, don't cram it down our throats"" it makes it feel forced, and takes away the impact of the character. But the main problem of focusing so much on her is that the main character in the story never really gets enough time to develop a character.2. The Mandarin, never feels really intimidating og loving, they try to be so middle of the road on everything with this character, that he neither feels believeable as any of those opposites or as ""real person"" in general. A shame because I don't think the actor is to blame, it is simply poor writing and directing.3. Shang Chi, doesn't feel like he has much impact on the story, especially in the second half, where the is more focus on secondary roles than him. And his impact on the final battle is minimal at best. The first half of the movie is clearly the stongest, and goes kinda downhill from there.There is one special cameo though, that is sure to delight and give some laughs.Over all it was worth a watch, but not much more than that."
"If you love marvel films you'll love this, huge amount of cgi but doesn't take away from the story or acting."
"Well, Marvel's phase 4 has started with an asian superhero. The introducing was good & also the first act.But then, it got slower. Things seemed like mess. I'm talking about the storytelling. It could be so much better.But you have to admit that actions were so fantastic as every Marvel films. Unique and spectacular sci fi actions. You can see clashing armies & big water bender dragons. This is all the movie has to show us. A misguided father & a mother who looks like Raya from Disney.So much marshal arts, destruction etc.Acting wasn't so good. You can see it totally that they gave their full efforts for the action scenes.For me, as usual Marvel movie & I don't think I'm gonna watch this movie again in theatre 'cause it isn't worth that much."
"Entertaining. Great effects, costumes, humour and cast. A fan of Simu's from Kim's Convenience so happy to see him get this monster role!! Akwafina is an adorable comic."
Only watch movie enjoy this is a master piece a great great movie.
"Today I watched and find nothing special
Nothing new and extraordinary."
"So superrrrb movie mind bloing 10 rings Do osm. Sang-chi and the legend of the ten rings , very smart grafics and power i so very happy marvell movie the best sang chi and avenger and game.LOVE YOU MARVEL."
"It's not an awful film but it's not good either. I thought the plot was weak, so we're the characters. The animation was okay but weak in points. It's definatly not in the league of other marvel films."
"I watched it in cinema, with bunch of jerks who wanted to ruin my impression of this film. And.. they failed the mission. I enjoyed the film so much! A lot of LotR vibes, but more like Hobbit to me (you know, fantasy world, city, lake, the rock, dragon from the mountain). Warm nostalgia about those Jackie Chan's action movies from childhood... and very, very beautiful locations! Nice cameos, like Abomination, Wong etc. Ben Kingsley was awesome as well!"
This movie will enter my top 5 best movies! The CGI was so good that my mouth opened widely after watched this movie.
"Best movie I've seen in a very long time. Beautiful story, beautiful imagery, great action scenes. Can't wait to watch again."
". . . haven't we heard all of this before? China is infamous for intellectual property theft, with TEN RINGS being a sterling example of such nefarious cultural shoplifting. Seldom credited with any originality beyond propagating Germs of Mass Destruction, it would surprise no one if this outlaw band of grifters opened up a fast food restaurant chain tomorrow selling warm dogs and ""Chinese fries"" under some Silver Arches. Allegedly respectful of elder tradition, those on the Sinus Front have yet to realize that all that glitters is not gold. As Ms. Stein famously observed, ""A bus is a bus is a bus, no matter how you slice it."""
"First off ,Tony Leung steals the movie. He's great as Shang-Chi's father and the head of Ten Rings (and not the Mandarin) .The movies starts as kind of Jackie Chan style action flick and morphs into kind of Kaiju movie. Kind wish it remain a straight kung fu movie. Not a big fan how the finally scenes is huge CGI fight. I guess it wouldn't be an MCU movie without a CGI fight.I felt the inclusion of Wong was little force in the middle of the movie."
"This is a beautiful film. There are some spectacular shots that you can tell are inspired by classes Chinese cinema. Wide shots of beautiful landscapes with real martial artists make you feel, sometimes, like you truly aren't just watching another Marvel movie, which even the best Marvel films struggle with.The story is good, though it does too often rely on the standard Marvel plot points that are in almost all of these movies. But the film is truly lifted up by its incredible action. This is hands down the best action in the MCU, and after seeing Black Widow, which was terrible, cutting every half second during fights, this film utilizing wide shots and long takes was a breath of fresh air. There's a lot to love here and if it wasn't for some of the odd choices and the humor, which was about 50/50 hit or miss for me, then this would be a 10 star film. It's definitely worth watching."
Easily one of the dullest movies I've seen a while. Obvious pandering. No depth. Absolutely woeful...
"Great origin movie, the best one so far in the mcu, a little bit long to start, but Great origin movie, the best one so far in the mcu, a little bit long to start, but from the moment the characters arrive in Macao till the end, the movie is really entertaining. If the movie has one problem, it's that it's super predictable (common for all the mcu sadly). Apart from that, I really liked the artistic direction based on Chinese mythology, combined with the great special effects and cgi it makes some super aesthetic and cool moments. I also want to highlight the charisma of Simu Liu (Shang-Chi) and especially the charisma of Tony Leung Chiu-Wai (Shang-Chi's father) which is just incredible. For the quality of acting, it was good, great for a mcu movie, but good overall (didn't really like the acting of Katy by Nora Lum, neither the prestations of the characters from Ta Lo, they don't embodies the wisdom we expect from them).Overall the story itself is great, even if it's mayne a little bit too classic (fight for the memory of the mother against a not-so-mean bad guy that will go to the light side at the end of the confrontation for finally sacrifice himself...) but all the atmosphere, the landscapes, the choreography of the fights, the special effects, some jokes, and the epicness make this film the best Marvel origin story so far and a great Marvel movie.7/10 for the movie itself, 9/10 for what this movie is doing for the Asian community, hope more people and children will be finally able to identify themselves in a superhero, really sad that this movie is banished in China..."
"It was typical marvel canon fodder. But that's not a bad thing. Its not ground breaking for the mcu. I think they mixed in iron fist elements, which I thought was tight. But otherwise it was like able characters, comedy, nice action and typical marvel stuff."
"Positives:
This is Marvel at its best. A script (with Shakespearean undertones) that melds action with good character development and laugh-out-loud feelgood dialogue. The great thing is that you don't need to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy this one. Yes, there are some fabulous Easter Eggs for Marvel fans (and a wonderful return of a character from one of the early films). But its almost a standalone feature in its own right.The action sequences are top-notch, particularly an early fight on a careering an Francisco ""bendy-bus"". Some great martial arts reminiscent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", made more exciting by the fact that the impressive Simu Liu did all his own stunts.The relationship built between Shaun and Katy is wonderful, and the actors deliver on it brilliantly: no wonder when you have the exceptional Awkwafina on the other end of it. Similarly, the relationship built between Shang-Chi and his father is powerful, thanks to some wonderful acting from Tony Chiu-Wai Leung. So good in the gripping (and erotic) 'Lust, Caution', I believe this is his first English-speaking film.With the odd exception (see below), the special effects are top-notch.Negatives:
I thought this was 5* all the way until the final reel, when we descended into a CGI-driven ""Godzilla vs Kong"" finale. I hate CGI that's just a blur of action across the screen where you're struggling to understand what's going on. Less would be more here for me.The movie makes extensive use of 'flashbacks' and, for me, there was a bit too much heavy-handedness in their use. I muttered ""enough already"" to a few of them, since they were taking us out of the movie's current narrative.There were a couple of effects that looked like the intern at the special effects company had put them together during a coffee break. An early plunge of a jeep into a forest and some rather obvious green-screen stuff in the finale. Surprised that these weren't caught and redone.Timeline?: So, it took more of a Marvel nerd than I am (my wonderful daughter-in-law Bronwyn) to point out that although this film is set (largely) in the ""Present Day"", the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" actually happen in 2023. So in the Marvel timeline, this is set in between Thanos's ""blip"" and ""the return"". This is the reason why Wong is present but not Doctor Strange, for example.Summary Thoughts: Marvel goes East! This is a really entertaining addition to the franchise, mixing Marvel action with Eastern mysticism and martial arts. It's an impressive job by director and co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton, in only his second feature (he did ""Just Mercy"" in 2019).As a Marvel film, there are of course end-credit scenes (""monkeys"" in onemannsmovies speak). A mid-title one is the best, bringing some additional Marvel characters into the mix. And there's a post-credits one which sets up for further sequels but which I found rather irritating.It's ironic that a Marvel movie so right for the Chinese market - the first to be headlined by an Asian actor and with substantial Mandarin dialogue - might not get a release in China. According to this report, this appears to be for two reasons: firstly that the actor Simu Liu made some derogatory remarks about China in the past, and secondly that in the comics Shang Chi's father is Fu Manchu - a Western-derived character with racial overtones.This doesn't seem to have hurt it so far. After less than two weeks of opening, it has made $262 million on a budget estimated to be $150-200 million.(For the full graphical review and video check out #onemannsmovies on the web, Facebook and Tiktok. Thanks)."
This movie served as an introduction to a brand new character and a whole new world as we learned about all sorts of magical places. I felt a connection to the characters all the way through and really loved the new places and concepts. Really excited to see more of this character and place.
"Having just enjoyed a series of Wong Kar-wei films, it was great to see the star of many of his classic features - Tony Leung - feature in this superior fantasy adventure. He is the man with the magical and all-powerful ten rings and two estranged children. It is only when his son ""Shaun"" (Simu Liu) has a lively altercation with some heavies on a San Francisco bus that he realises there is impending danger, seeks out his independently minded sister and before you know it, the family are - somewhat unwillingly - reunited and working together to rescue their late, lamented mother from the clutches of an evil being protected by a benign society led by Michelle Yeoh. To be honest, the story isn't the best - it's actually a little bit simple and predictable. That said, however, the characterisations are engaging and the action scenes are well staged and paced. There is an interesting underlying premiss that has to resonate now as the planet appears to be fighting back against mankind's accumulated indifference - the Elysian utopia that ""Xu Wenwu"" (Leung) must invade to rescue his wife being symbolic of the unspoilt elements of the planet that have no intention of rolling over peaceably whilst we impose ourselves on it. The production standards are typically high, with plenty of cute and dangerous beasties to suit and please all ages. There is also quite a fun series of scenes from Sir Ben Kingsley as a Liverpudlian poet (maybe his accent isn't the best!) before a stylishly crafted finale. All told, this is a thoroughly entertaining watch that at over two hours flies by."
"Another great Marvel origin story. Cast are all excellent especially Awkwafina in a comedic role & Ben Kingsley getting some love after his undeserved trouncing as ""The Mandarin"" in Iron Man 3 (i liked it). Marvel have another winner on their hands."
Was super excited going to see Shang-Chi and i wasn't disappointed. The Shang-Chi childhood back story scenes were amazing&very well done. The action/ fighting scene were also do well . A overall good movie straight out of the MCU playbook. When it works it works&more than not it always works for the MCU . Please Start taking notes DCEU .And a epic post scene cameo by captain marvel and Bruce banner .
"Very good movie. Perfect casting,great visuals,Good story and direction makes it enjoyable.the screenplay was a little bit predictable like formulatic marvel movie. I totally recommend to see this one in theaters because it was made to have that kind of experience."
"*spoilers below*Shang-Chi is an interesting installation in the MCU, because it introduces fresh elements that bring an exciting performance to screen, and then turns right around and bogs itself down by reminding you that it is still a Marvel movie. It is an interesting dichotomy that I feel highlights the glaring issues in the MCU right now.Starting off with what I like: the performances in this movie are top notch. Tony Leung's as the main antagonist is by far one of my favorite MCU villain iterations in recent history, which is also a point of frustration as well, but I will get into that later. The choreography of the fight sequences deserve every praise they receive and the narratives of living up to the expectations of your family along with a family all trying to deal with the grief of loss makes for one of the more compelling stories that Marvel has told in some time.What I didn't like: Tony Leung's character has arguably one of the more compelling villain stories in the MCU. He's not just an evil asshole looking to dominate the world. He's a grieving widow, and the relationship with his children become entangled with and complicated by his overwhelming grief. So why Marvel once again chose to continue perpetuating this cycle of killing off their villains I do not understand in this instance.The point in the movie where it switches from action packed fighting choreography to CGI battle royale monster slaying is where I genuinely think the movie loses a lot of the progress it made by trying to be something different. It hits the exact same troupes of Marvel movies past, and not in a good way. Shang-Chi's conflict with his father was the most engaging plot point of the movie, and then slows down right into ""psychic demon eating dimension bad must now stop"".Some of the exposition, particularly in the middle, is a bit excessive. There was probably at least a solid 15-20 minutes that they could have shaved off the run time.Overall, it is still a fun time to be had. If you love the MCU, this is likely a film that you will thoroughly enjoy. It shines best when it tries not to be a Marvel film, but then unfortunately finds it's way right back into business as usual."
"As the title says, I would recommend this movie to anyone who is already interested in it, as well as to anybody who is looking for a light kung fu inspired action comedy. I was largely disinterested in the dramatic scenes as I found the a little sitcomy feeling, which is fitting as both Simu Liu and Awkwafina have backgrounds in tv comedy series' , but it unfortunately left most of the drama feeling flat in my experience, I did find the action scenes and general sense of style (especially in the first act) to be quite commendable. Despite my general disinterest with the dramatic scenes I found the emotional climax to be quite compelling and well handled, so for these reasons I would recommend the movie to anyone who based on the promotional material is interested in seeing it, but I find myself weary to recommend anyone who found the promotional material to be disengaging as I did, as overall the movie was in my experience, just okay."
Good kung fu coupled with good plot. Turned out to be very entertaining.
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings far surpassed any expectations I had. It's easily the best Marvel movie post-Infinity Saga (I know, that's not exactly saying much), and is very promising for the quality of Marvel's next projects. We have probably the second best villain intimately tied to the origin of a new, entertaining, and capable hero full of potential, in a story that ties the universe together and teases upcoming events in tantalising and unexpected ways. The fight choreography was on point, the dialogue was seeped in cultural significance, the jokes all land, and the CGI is some of the best since Thanos himself. Shang-Chi is an all-out success for Marvel, it seems in multiple ways - both critically and financially. Really its only downfall is that at times this doesn't feel like that much of a movie about Shang-Chi himself purely because his origin is tied so closely to the story of the Ten Rings. Instead it's a Ten Rings movie featuring Shang-Chi, which is fine, but feels a bit weird for his introduction into the MCU. And yes, the Ten Rings are tied up with the Iron Man films perfectly, almost making the whole Aldrich Killian thing better in retrospect. I give Shang-Chi a high 8/10, with promise of moving up with rewatches."
"There are, of course, a lot of changes that had to be made between the comic book character and his Disney-fied counterpart. First and foremost being Shang-chi's paternal heritage! As Marvel no longer had licensing rights to the name ""Fu Manchu,"" the hero's villainous father had to be revised to being the true Mandarin (as opposed to Ben Kingsley's politically incorrect caricature as a terrorist group figurehead).Then, there's Shang-chi's sister. Instead of Fah Lo Suee (another literary character licensed to the Estate of Sax Rohmer), we have Xu Xialing. And, for Shang-Chi's girlfriend, we get American-born Katy. An original character who seems to be an amalgam of Leiko Wu and Misty Knight. Which only stands to reason, I suppose, as Shang-chi's maternal heritage seems to amalgamate his silver screen origin with the comic book origin of Iron Fist!Most important of all, however, is the emotional plausibility. Simu Liu provides that, for this version of Shang-Chi, the same way Tobey Maguire first brought believability to the cinematic Peter Parker.All in all? Not a bad way to transition from the end of summer into the next phase of Marvel Films."
Overall the movie was absolutely fantastic!Best origin story to any character in the MCU.The jokes were timed very well and they were pretty hilarious. The villain and hero dynamic was very interesting. The fight scenes are by far the best in any superhero movie.
"Let me preface this by saying that my enjoyment of the movie may have been dampered by a poor night's sleep. That being said, the middle 45 minutes of this film had me nearly falling asleep, literally. The character development just couldn't hook me at all because it felt like they kept revisiting the same points.On a positive note, the visuals and martial arts are absolutely spectacular. The first act of the film contains most of the martial arts and it is so crisp and well-choreographed. The final act flexes all of the CGI dollas and they make they already big budget stretch far, with some of the more impressive sights you will see in a Marvel movie so far. This movie didn't quite hit the 8/10 for me to recommend people see it in theatres, but lets tack that up to me being tired and you go see it anyway!"
"What began as a middling Marvel film was taken up a few notches thanks to some well done fight choreography and heart. I would have rated this a 9. However, Awkwafina's acting and/or character wasn't needed past the first act. She seemed out of place and shoehorned in much of the film. Her voice and presence was annoying. Moreover, the controversy surrounding her was a distraction though warranted. I really hope she isn't brought back."
"It's nothing but a larger than life chinese martial art movie in fantasy, action, adventure genre.....No way upto Marvel standard.....Yeah budget is high so the action sequences, VFX and graphics are great.....but the story or the theme is same as of those fantasy action adventure chinese movies.... it's nothing new.Presenting a old dish adding some spices in new plate.... that's it.I personally don't like it."
"I enjoyed this more than Black Widow. Black Widow wasn't bad, but when you've had two great Spider-Man's, a fantastic Captain America or two and the amazing Infinity war....well Black Widow just seems meh.But why are we talking about that when now we have Shang Chi.To give it's complete title that would also include the legend of the 10 rings.Overall I enjoyed this but the pity is the weak and predictable ending. The obligatory 2 end credit scenes are also there.Where it excels is the first 2/3rds. It has a very Spider-Man feel to it in the sense of easy going humour. The fight scenes are great....although some seem simply contrived to show off martial arts being performed in a different to the usual place martial arts films usually have their fights.....but then Jackie Chan films have been doing this stuff decades ago. Still fun though.There are some neat touches involving referencing characters introduced in other Marvel films which adds a different dimension and pleases some of the fan base.But ultimately, it all winds up like a million other big budget fighting the monster in the end of film blockbuster. Lots of bangs, exposition, non sensical OTT fight scenes and a little perplexing how we even got here.It suffers from sugar coated neatness.After all, this film starts well with some dark tones along the way but ends up being too neat. Like a moral compass advert for how ideally one's life can be redeemed by not being a dick for a few seconds.Still as popcorn movies go (and boy have we missed them these past two years), this is perfectly serviceable.Nowhere on par with the two recent spideys. In fact, I'ld say if you can hold out till it gets to Disney+ next month (October 2021), watch it then for nothing more as it's included with your subscription.I must say, Marvel (Disney) are churning out same ole same ole....nothing new whereas DC are knocking it out the park.....first with the excellently unsettling Joker and the recent The Suicide Squad. With The Batman possibly delivering on it's Riddler promise, we may have a shift back to DC in terms of power balance. This is surprising to me as DC have churned out some proper crud over the years.I wish the scripts pushed the envelope by telling interesting, engaging and intelligent stories.Unfortunately, there really is nothing original or revealing about Shang Chi. It's a safe film. Fun but ultimately forgettable."
"I entered the theatre to watch 'Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' with skepticism as I was pretty much disappointed with the Phase 4 of Marvel films. Though, the story is predictable, it is the Philosophy that makes the film worthwhile. The Philosophy of Maya which is unexplored in films from Indian subcontinent despite having the origins from the same and Hollywood doing justice to the dogma, oh boy, I am thrilled. Kudos, Marvel."
"My preconception of this film was ""meh"" as I didn't feel it would be a significant entry to the MCU canon. Luckily my 17 year old son really wanted to see it so when I suggested an impromptu trip to the cinema that was the film ""we"" chose.It's tempting to make comparisons to ""Black Panther"" as I felt the representation of Chinese people and culture was similar to the African representation in BP but it stands alone in its own right and there are some great call backs to Phase 1 which I won't spoil. MCU fans you won't be disappointed."
"I liked it as an MCU movie, and I am super excited to see what comes next. Bit my only problem js some of the jokes don't land and it feels a bit long at some parts. But the emotional beats are beautiful. Good movie, if you like action go watch it."
The story of Shang Chi isn't intriguing much. But the story of Xialing is! Honestly Shang Chi is least interestimg character in his own film. But the film is extremely pleasing to eyes.
"I'm a Singaporean so I do know I'm probably not the target audience for this movie. Nonetheless, it's Marvel so I got to watch it.Pros:
1. I like the special effects when they fight2. Many Chinese dialogues in the movie. I'm the only one laughing in the cinema though. Especially when Tony Leung said ""I ate more salt than you ate rice"", that's exactly what my parents always say.Cons:
1. Too much exposition. The dead mother starts it off, then Shang-Chi to Katy, then Tony Leung, then Michelle Yeoh.2. The costumes that the people in Talo wear are ugly. C'mon, just because they're Chinese doesn't mean they wear red colour like it's Chinese New Year everyday.3. Why does Xia Ling's hairstyle look so ugly? It's a straight fringe, mushroom head hairstyle. The actress' real life hair looks pretty. Are they trying to make her look ""uglier"" to align with Liu Simu?4. Shang-Chi is supposed to be in his 20's? Too bad Liu Simu looks his real life age.5. Archery scene ripped off The Hobbit. What are the odds that Awkwafina's arrow is the one that pierced the dragon?6. Awkwafina is a Mary-Sue. So she is not only smart (Berkeley), good driver, she also mastered archery in 2 days. I would have liked to see a training montage and she improving, not getting a bullseye from the start. She is not relatable to Asians. Asians hate other Asians who are just effortlessly talented.7. No suspense. We are not scared of our main characters ever dying.8. It's strange how Marvel don't want Katy and Shang Chi to be dating but hints at it, like they are intimate than platonic friends. Guess Marvel doesn't do romance well."
"Story beats we've seen a thousand times before, and sort of a bare-bones narrative structure. From a visual effects point-of view, however, it is a masterpiece, and the fight choreography is nearly on par with ""The Raid."" Also, why does every comic book superhero have daddy issues?"
"Shang-Chi was hyped so much and I thought it'd be a great movie, something new for the MCU, but it's more or less the same sort of plot, same sort of characters, same sort of disappointing villains. Marvel are getting into this 'thing' where they make you think the villain is one thing but it ends up being something else and I'm not really a fan of that. CGI was laughable in some parts but not all that bad. Refreshing movie though, some of the best fight scenes we've seen so far in the MCU. They went with the whole family thing, we've seen it a thousands times, but they did a good job at it, was pretty emotional at parts.People who are rating it low for being 'boring' have been spoiled by Infinity War and Endgame thinking there needs to be hundreds of cameos and all the Avengers in every Marvel movie. Grow up, this is a solo movie. Simple as. Same type of people who rated Black Widow low because of that. It's not as bad as some people are saying, it's a good introduction movie for Shang-Chi's character and the post-credits also leave room for the next MCU projects to come. Could develop into something great if they do it right."
It was fun and enjoyable which is rule number 1 for a good film. Has its flaws but I don't care I had a good time with it and brought in many possibilities to this large Universe of madness.
"Bit slow, poor writing, not so funny, boring ending.Visuals are good.This movie made black panther look good."
I don't care about this because I want something nicer & cooler.
Some innovative but non-perilous fights.Sets up a hopefully more complete Marvel story thread.Great to see Trevor again.A rehash of Kung Fu Panda 3 minus the dumplings.
"No real feeling for the characters, some weird ways the movie attempted to make me care but I didn't.When a certain character dies I was disappointed as I thought they could've had a better arc."
"I know that I'm going to get blasted, but I was really disappointed with this movie. The fight scenes were OK, but Katy, one of the main characters, tried too hard to be funny (and wasn't.) She was the most annoying MCU character I've ever seen.I'm not Asian, but I felt very uncomfortable with the not so subtle jabs at the Asian-American culture vs ancient Chinese one. The main characters seemed to ""Whitewashed"" to be taken as Asian heros.I did enjoy the AMC Dolby Atmos technology though."
"For a more than 2h fim it is ok, good pace, nice visual effects, nice fights (not too long) and blah blah.... I enjoyed the film so I noted based on thatBut I've learn something in it:
1) Asians don't mix with white people in US..not even talk to them.2) white guys are only bad guys (not even bus drivers or streamers...)
3) a woman never loses a fightshould I be surprised?"
"Totally unpopular opinion here and I might be the only one, but I really didn't like it; even going into it with no expectations. I wasn't too keen on the movie in the first place, but I was swayed by everybody who watched it and said it was brilliant. What a mistake. I felt the movie was incredibly dull, generic, utterly cliched and stereotyped. Crap characters, formulaic plot, and not even all that funny. As soon as the movie opened with a Chinese battle banner and the twang of guzheng notes, I knew it would be bad. The action and fight scenes aren't even all that great: they relied way too much on CG. I feel like the action was nothing special: Jackie Chan (and Yuen Wah whom you'll see in Shang Chi) in his hey-day produced way better action and fights without CG. Back when The Matrix first came out, that was mind-blowing action that Western audiences haven't seen before. If you've seen any number of Hong Kong martial arts movies you'll know what I mean. The third act of the movie was a total rip-off of the last battle in How to Train Your Dragon. Also an absolute waste of great actors like Michelle Yeoh who was given nothing to do, she practically dialled in her part. Positives though: Tony Leung. He's the one redeeming grace of this terrible and lazy movie."
"Was fun until Pokemons showed up, should have stuck to martial arts."
"What a great start for the Phase 4. Fresh, and has a strong character arc. Went over my expectations. Simu Liu seems fit and perfect for the role, alongside with the legends (Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh) making this movie much more enjoyable.Also, great scores! Overall, this is as good as Black Panther. Can't wait to see what happens next for Shang-Chi.And as Chinese-descendant, those ""asian parent trying to raise a perfect kid"" thing got me.PS: I recommend you guys watch it in cinema."
I love shangchi becasue the story is good also the fighting. Very recommended to watch...üôÇüëç
I didn't expect it to be good so the outcome was estonishing I really liked it was funny had great fighting the charecters were good the bad guy was good overall the movie was great.
"This movie have little comedy like ant man, this movie have to been in you guys watchlist."
I'll start by saying I'm generally pretty sick of the glut of superhero movies that have dominated blockbusters for so many years now. Marvel in particular have gotten to the point where I feel many of their movies are just the same old things rehashed over and over.So I wasn't expecting much from this superhero film based on a character I'd never heard of. What a pleasant surprise it was. A movie with interesting characters that had plenty of depth. A superb cast good enough that even Michelle Yeoh's usual outstanding performance didn't upstage everyone else. Beautiful visuals like you'd expect from some of the better recent chinese films rather than a Marvel film. And the action and visual effects didn't disappoint.Well worth seeing on the big screen to truly appreciate.
"Amazing cast,Amazing fighting scenes and an interesting story one of Marvels finest!"
"The visual effects combined with the martial arts looked very pleasing and well-executed. Another new world of fantasies and mystical creatures was enthralling. The plot was quite compelling given the dark history of Shang-Chi's father. The story around his parents' was well done too. It's a great addition to the Marvel Universe, as well as the action genre."
"The fight scenes would be better if they were more grounded in reality, instead of the dragon thing. You have a character who's been introduced for the first time, and you shouldn't add bunch of other elements to it.7*s for Andy Le <3."
"I've said this before about Marvel movies: they are a victim of their own success. ""Shang-Chi"" had to follow up a decade and a half of quality MCU movies, so the same movie that would've been a smash 10 years ago isn't viewed quite the same today. The movie was good, but it failed to really separate itself.""The Legend of Ten Rings"" as a title already sounds too much like LOTR. And in fact it was something like it in that he with the rings had the power. Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) had the ten rings which gave him near omnipotence. With the ten rings he could defeat entire armies and live forever. He decided to use the rings to become a tyrant.He was willing to put his rings aside and grow old for the love of his life, a woman he found after living 1000 years. I thought it was a bit strange that it took the man 1000 years to find his true love, but I didn't dwell on it.Stranger than him taking a thousand years to find his true love was the woman who fell in love with him. She lived in a secret magical village in Macao that was totally isolated from the rest of the world. She was a gentle benign character who had powers herself and was able to defeat Wenwu when he came to essentially conquer her village. Somehow, through their Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-esque battle they fell in love. Maybe that makes sense for him being that he finally found someone who could defeat him, but it didn't make sense for this nearly pure woman to fall for a man with a 1000 year history of tyranny.Still, they wed, forsook their powers and started a family.Their family would be unceremoniously destroyed when an old foe of Wenwu--a vicious gang--came by their house to get their pound of flesh and killed Wenwu's wife, Li (Fala Chen). Li could've attempted to barter with them for some sort of material exchange for their past losses, but instead she immediately decided she'd try to fight the entire gang and lost her life in the process. That would cause Wenwu to don the ten rings again and return to tyranny.So, if you're keeping score on Wenwu's wife, 1.) she was smitten with a man who came to destroy her village and 2.) she chose to fight an entire gang with no powers to speak of and with no attempts to negotiate.I recognize that it was a plot device to advance the plot, but it could've been done a lot better and with more tact. Her character never struck me as someone impulsive and/or not able to judge character yet she exhibited both flaws.Most of what I've covered was garnered throughout the movie via flashbacks. The real main character was Saun aka Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). He was the son of Wenwu and Li. Years later we see an adult Saun. He lives in SF and is a valet. He is violently thrust back into the life he ran away from when his father's goons came for the pendant around his neck given to him by his mother. It was at this point we learned his backstory, of which I've given some already. We find out he also has a sister, Xialing (Meng'er Zhang), who Disney not so subtly informed us she had to train herself to become a fierce warrior because of her gender. The two of them had been split up for close to twenty years when Saun ran away after being trained to be an assassin by his father. He was fourteen at the time and she was ten when he promised her he'd be back. He never came back and when they met again in Macao as adults she held the same ten-year-old bitterness against him for running away as though a fourteen-year-old should've been more reliable. She greeted him with a butt-kicking that was twenty years in the making. It's clear that it never crossed her mind that he may have been killed, or maybe she would've considered his death a betrayal as well. Either way it was a completely childish way to handle reuniting with your long lost brother.The two of them would join forces along with Saun's friend Katy (Awkwafina) and really quickly to stop their father. He was going to use the ten rings to breach a portal to another dimension which contained some soul-sucking demons.The introduction of demons to the movie did offer some excitement. It upped the stakes of everyone involved and thrust another Marvel character into the role of saving the world.Saun would save the world with the help of his friends and family. Some would die, but the most important characters lived. I was somewhat satisfied with the movie. The acting was commendable and Awkwafina was good as the comic relief. ""Shang-Chi"" may just be the placement of a singular brick to build to something bigger, I just hope what Marvel is building towards is worth it."
"This was a good movie,1. Even though my wife and I don't usually like this genre, we enjoyed this one.2. Nora Lum stole the movie. Look for her in future films.3. The prettiest actress in the film was Fela Chen, even though she played the mother. Also ;ook for her in future films."
"'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is the latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring MCU newcomers Simu Liu as the titular character and Tony Leung as 'Wenwu' and, at last, the definitive portrayal of 'The Mandarin'. Helmed by director Destin Daniel Cretton this picture injects the perfect amount of Asian culture into this enormous franchise.The cast is stellar, especially Liu who wished this role into existence years ago on social media and I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. He has brilliant on screen chemistry with co-star Awkwafina who plays 'Katy', Shang-Chi's best friend. Katy acts as the audiences lens into this world. She is just a normal person and I feel her role is pivotal in helping general audiences digest a story with this many magical elements. Thanks to Leung's performance 'Wenwu' has become one of the best MCU villains. He is the excellent blend of menacing and sympathetic with understandable motives.The fight choreography is second to none in the MCU. They linked perfectly with the set pieces created for this film. They were excellent, in particular the Bus fight scene and the final fight between Wenwu and Shang-Chi. These brilliant pieces of action were achieved through the lack of camera cuts and smooth camera movements to exhibit the skilled choreography. Along with the set pieces, the overall look of this film is stunning. There are some especially beautiful shots within the final fight scene which makes up for some of the routine Marvel tropes which this picture eventually falls into.The main themes of family and grief are incredibly heartfelt. They're told expertly through these characters and are deeply rooted in Asian culture, something this film showcases with perfection. From the Ten Rings compound to the Golden Daggers Club in Macau to the fictional land of Ta Lo, the Asian culture is always on show and this film, along with the wider MCU, benefits from it tenfold.However, this film is not as perfect as it could've been, thanks in large part to the Marvel formula which this picture falls into like many of it's predecessors. This is most apparent in the 3rd act which not only drags on for too long, but also turns into big CGI monster vs big CGI monster once again. When I believe a more grounded martial-arts style fight would've been more fitting.Overall, 'Shang-Chi' began as a breath of fresh air into this franchise, with deeply rooted themes, a gargantuan cast and stunning fight choreography until it gave in to the ordinary marvel formula which has plagued this genre since it's inception. Despite this, the future looks bright for these characters and the post-credit scene cements the titular character as an MCU mainstay for years to come.8.5/10."
"No hay nada m√°s emocionante que descubrir la historia de origen den un h√©roe, y sumado a un nuevo h√©roe es doblemente emocionante."
"The imagery in the film is unique for Marvel and beautiful, but the plot leaves much to be desired. Shang Chi's father and sister are probably the best developed characters, but I hope future movies will develop Awkwafina's character more because she is hilarious."
"To be honest the trailer didn't lure me that much. But being a Marvel fan, and being really curious what will happen in this phase, I went.And boy!This was so worth the money!It ticked all the boxes what I look for in movies.It has a storyline that's interesting, it's also relatable.I ab-so-lut-ely love the mythological themes in this and how excellent the special effects were done to bring them to life!So the fantasy-theme and mythological themes, but also the friendship and family balance and developments were really nice to see!Acting work was fantastically performed.And, because Marvel, the level of surprises and humor was well above level 10 of appreciation for me (""Shang Chi?"" ""Present!"").I am very curious what the future will bring.Plus the music and the camera work was amazing (the camera dude did the Matrix too, so that's definitely a big win).Last but not least, I was afraid of the disconnection to the Avengers or other superheroes, but this was referring to our former and older Avengers in a very smart way.And at the very last; it left us with enough and good questions to keep us peaked for the upcoming films!"
"This was a risk making a movie starring a mostly Asian cast, and i have to say that it paid off! Simu Liu was truly perfect casting! He not only got the essence of the character, making him relatable and likeable, but it seemed that he helmed much of the action scenes. There were multiple wide shots of hand to hand combats that absolutely blew my mind. I could not stop smiling!The director did an absolutely fantastic job leading this film. I just wished the 2nd act of the movie was paced a bit quicker. There was some set up during the second act that I wish perhaps came at the beginning. But this is a very very minor critique, and it may just be a me thing.All in all, this is the type of movie I want to pay to see. Please Hollywood, make more movies like this: movies with heart and conviction in the craft!"
"I see this as fresh for marvel. Background score is good and character design could have improved a bit. If you compare this with DC's aquaman, still aquaman wins."
"This movie is great, one if the best from marvel. 9/10 legendary rings."
"Amazing performance from Simu Liu. So glad that the first Asian led film was such a success, hopefully it paves the way for many more.Plot line was excellent, can easily be watched as a standalone, while still connecting with the MCU for ultra-fans."
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the new installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It stars Simu Liu as his first lead role, slings with Akwafina, Michelle Yeoh, and the great Tony Leung.Ricky Gervais has said it clearly before: Actors nowadays do adventure fantasy nonsense, their job isn't acting but going to the gym and taking steroids.Shang-Chi is nothing but an ""adventure fantasy nonsense"". It features some of the most ridiculous scenes in the MCU and some awkward green-screen scenes.Simu Liu is Shang-Chi, who has a rivalry with his father (Tony Leung). Actors here don't do a bad job, but you don't really feel for the character Shang-Chi.Tony Leung is a master of acting. It's a shame we dont get more dramatic scenes with him. Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley's characters are the comic relief characters, which, every Marvel movie needs apparently.A major bragging point of the MCU movies is how they don't feel like a MCU film. But when you have ridiculous moments like those in Shang-Chi, it doesn't always work that well."
"Alright I get it, if you're not a fan of the character you're not gonna like it but I've watched movies before where I had no clue who the character was and it was still great because those movies made me care for them.I think the acting is pretty decent, the actors do a good job being funny and some of the action scenes are pretty awesome but that's already expected from a MCU production, my real issue with this movie is it's plot, it's a tale about a chinese warrior that doesn't use his abilities for sht even though he was raised to be a fighter and do something but instead he just runs away and hides in new york with this boring comic relief/love interest character, and leaves his sister behind not even caring about it, alright i can buy all that but where's his motivation?Then suddenly a guy with a sword in his arms appears and steals his necklace and he starts to do something about it, wow what an amazing chinese hero let's give some applause...Plus his dad/villain is totally forgettable, the whole relationship is poorly written, in one scene he says he's going to kill his dad and in the other he basically forgot about it, the dad doesn't have one scene of development, his character is weak af probably one of the worst antagonists in the MCU, the CGI dragons are pretty amazing but other than that it's just another formula marvel bull and totally forgettable."
It's not a must watch movie.But it was good enough for a fun evening at the cinema.The visuals and some fighting scenes were great!
"One of best solo hero films from marvel. Good action last 30 minutes are bang on. Martial arts action in whole film. Nice story. Emotional combo, binds you in the story. Nice cast, acting, bang on. Sound tracks are good. Vfx are good. Post credit scenes are good."
"In the future we need more fantasy open world series in MARVEL its kinda trending for along time , fans and peoples waiting for something like this , its hype above all movies...
So the myth has been adapted in movies ,mystical beings fought face to face , it's been a long time to watch movie like , we did watch chinese fantasy series with low budget dragons & mystical beings , but not like this , we could see proper visual effect arts of the fight , I wish marvel studios could do more beast fighting in fantasy realm with HEREOS and VILLAINS, or LIMBO like Devil may cry kind of... yeah it does looks like DANTE running above dragon back fighthing his Devil father.. end up his father saved him and let him inherit the fortunes power of the families.. anyway im still waiting DEVIL may cry movie live action , i dont know when the hollywood going to adapt the movie someday.. i hope the dream come true for all of us.. If you want more profit just do movie like this , peoples like it very much.. fantasy all.. humans dreams to be like that , but it will happen only in afterlife... i mean for real , you should check your religion books about afterlife.."
"Yeah this is a really enjoyable film. Is it anything that unique or incredible...kind of. The action definitely is. The action is by far the greatest part of the movie, damn does it look sick. The choreography is excellent, the fighting is so fluid, it's so fast paced and carries momentum throughout. All that is due to the vfx which are ofc good for such a high budget film. Now where I think the movie messed up a bit was the villain. The villain isn't bad per say but is just really bland and unoriginal, it actually gets really predictable towards the end. Also the ending is just absolutely crazy. Now don't get me wrong crazy is absolutely great for an over the top movie like this but it did take me out of the movie. The first section of the movie tho! AMAZING! The middle chunk...meh and the final mehWOWmeh. The soundtrack is good. The side characters are stale. And the comedy is actually surprisingly good, but sometimes misplaced into serious scenes. That's about it...it's...it's good!"
"Oke I saw the suicide squat yesterday and just saw chang-chi and the ten rings.. this is why I love marvel so much. They know how to make something so stupid, really fantastic. What a difference! And how the story lines also come together nicely. I am proud. In addition, it is also wonderful to see Japanese fighting scenes again. It was a party, thanks Marvel."
"Shaun (Simu Liu) and Katy (Awkwafina) are parking valets underachievers in San Francisco. Katy refers to herself as ""the Asian Jeff Gordon."" After a fight on a bus where Shaun reveals himself as a martial arts fighter, the two of them travel to China so he can reunite with his sister (Meng'er Zhang) after six years. He was raised to be an assassin and to make a long story short, the opening sequence comes into play as they have to save the world.Marvel has done it again with graphics, special effects, characters, and the right blend of humor. I fell in love with Katy who was our voice of reason and comedy. I was so afraid they were going to Emma Stone her to death. If you love what Marvel has done in the past and are getting bored with them attempting to figure what to do after Thanos, then this is must see."
"This is by far THE BEST marvel movie there is! And yes, I've seen them all. And no, I'm not asian."
"For nearly ten years after its inception, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was dominated by the adventures of white men. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow had to fight to get her own film this year, while her male co-stars got entire trilogies . ""Black Panther"" reinvigorated the franchise with its celebration of African culture in 2018, proving that the Marvel brand didn't have to be so beige. ""Captain Marvel"" became the first MCU film to be fronted by a woman. Now, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" marks the first Asian-led film. Not only does the film feature the first Asian protagonist, it also features a predominantly Asian cast and crew, which, thankfully, give this franchise a much needed change in perspective.The Ten Rings have been around for nearly a thousand years, gifting their wearer, Wenwu, immortality so that he may rule with unmatched strength. After centuries of building an empire out of blood, Wenwu was turned away from a life of violence by Ying Li, a guardian of the mystical land of Ta Lo. When heartbreak struck shortly after, Wenwu picked up the rings once again, causing him to go down a dark path, and his son, Shang-Chi, to run away to the United States. Now after ten years, the son must come home to confront his father and become who he was truly meant to be.Similar to what Ryan Coogler was able to do with ""Black Panther"", co-writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton brings out the best of this new world as he is able to handle the mountains of establishing exposition. His use of flashbacks may be a bit liberal, especially as the film reaches its climax, but they're used meaningfully to build upon a story focused on character and culture.Without a leading acting credit to his name, Simu Liu takes the titular role by storm as he navigates this typical hero's journey with charm and composure. Mixing a bit of T'Challa with Tony Stark, Shang-Chi is a hero battling with his past and future. Liu and Cretton strike a great balance as Liu hands himself over to Cretton's material in the somber moments, and Cretton lets Liu's comedic instincts light up the room.Veteran Tony Leung brings the same melancholic energy to Wenwu as he did in his roles with Wong Kar-wai, particularly his work in ""In the Mood for Love."" Leung layers this villain and distances him from the average world dominator. He carries a stillness about him that inspires fear and compassion, two things that have made some of the greatest villains.The overall narrative within a Marvel film is evenly composed of the plot and the action. Thankfully, Cretton blends both those halves together as he imbues the setpieces with the qualities of the wuxia genre, taking after such films as Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (also starring Michelle Yeoh) and Zhang Yimou's ""House of Flying Daggers."" The action often tells as much of the story as the dialogue, particularly in the gracefully dazzling opening sequence. But there's also room for brutality as the first act ends with a tower-scaffolding brawl where Shang-Chi's emotions turn him into a raw killer. Not since ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" has the action been so impactful on a technical and emotional level.When allowed to be its own film, ""Shang-Chi"" is quite the spectacle. But when it gets forcefully molded into a Marvel film, the results are less than stellar. Even after all his work with the story and action, Cretton can't break free from the third-act visual effects extravaganza that holds this franchise like an iron vice. It's a shame as the smaller familial moments do more for the mind and soul than the forgettable litany of explosions that encompass the final thirty minutes. Being that this is the 25th film in the franchise, I've come to expect that level of disappointment.Thanks to its multi-talented cast and crew, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is one of the better origin stories within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The action may (rightfully) be the selling point, but the heart of the film lies within its characters, telling a familiar story on an impressive scale."
Part of the problem was Undoubtedly I expected too much of it after seeing the trailers. The storyline is largely all over the place and not very interesting. The biggest problem I have with the movie is it's formulaic ....I've seen it all before. Marvel is better than that but unfortunately in their last two movies the story just wasn't strong enough.If I'm honest when it came to the end fight I just didn't care anymore and was bored by it.I personally didnt find the movie funny either.
"Unfortunately, I didn't find this origin story to be as good as other reviews. It was too fast in building the characters for an origin story. They could have just focused more on the dad and his early days and his overwhelming love or first love in a 1,000 years. Bring more heart into this story and the family. The father was almost a antagonist you wanted to feel some heart for, but they didn't show enough love. Hopefully, he becomes a great character in phase 4."
"The first part of the movie is great, I mean I like the scene where Shang chi's father met mother. It was a beautiful story.But then, everything is disappointing from that point.I am confused about the storyline. Why would Shang Chi escape and left his sister ? Its not like his dad is abusing him. He trained to become an assassin to avenge his mother AT HIS WILL. He trained until his fist is bloody AT HIS WILL too. At this point, no concrete reason why he would escape as his father is not abusive towards him too. He can just watched his mother died to protect them. Yeah hes not guilty for that. And he said hes gonna kill his father ?Yeah right. Again no concrete reason.Simu Liu is great with comedic scenes but remains stoic in the sentimental scenes. It is really hard to see him as marvel heroes as his facial expression and vibes does not support that. No father-son chemistry too with his father, Tony Leung. Think his acting is overshadowed by Tony Leung.Also father just die like that. No sentimental scenes whatsoever. Shang Chi even seems relieved his father is gone."
"Shang-Chi has great special effects and a compelling storyline but the script doesn't get too emotionally deep. This is one of the major liabilities of trying to tell a good story in about 2 hours. You simply can't because it takes time for viewers to develop care, concern, and emotional attachment to characters. So, what is best told in 2 hours? Robust short stories with excellent special effects that can only be enjoyed on the big screen. To this end Shang-Chi delivers in loads. The action is fast and the camera work while a bit dizzying captures the action very well. The only major issue I had with the plot is with the monsters that the heroes are fighting against. If you watch Chinese wuxia or xianxia dramas, you know that stories involving magical beasts are always based on Chinese mythology, Taoism, Buddhist, Chinese folk religion, traditional medicine, etc. Taoist immortals spouting what sounds like gibberish to laypeople is a classic character trope. The evil creatures that Shang-Chi fights against do not fit into the xiaxia genre world view. If they are demons no explanation is given for why they are so demonic? Have they been denounced by a bohisattva? Are they former immortals who failed to cultivate and somehow reincarnated into the hungry ghost realm? It may just be that wuxia and xianxia are so deeply developed (and this is obvious when you watch any popular Chinese historical drama--from ""Eternal Love"" ot ""Legend of Fuyao"") that deivating from these highly developed genres makes the film feel less ""Chinese"". While many elements of Shang-Chi resemble a Chinese fantasy drama the lack of proper wuxia and xianxia elements makes it feel like philosophically something is missing--at least from someone who watches a lot of these dramas on Rakuten Viki!"
After Black Widow disappointed.... Shang Chi will blow ur mind... visual treat.Prefect for big screens.
"It was a really good movie, I enjoyed watching it.."
"There are two things I have to say about this movie. One, there was no moment where I felt like my attention was drifting off to something else than the movie. Two, there was so many beautiful scenes."
"The Marvel Cinematic Universe made a big impact with an almost all-black cast in Black Panther, then this film came along and gave the world its first high-profile Asian superhero, and from the trailer I saw, it looked very exciting. Basically, thousands of years ago, Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) discovered ten mystical iron rings, granting its user immortality and other great powers. He establishes the Ten Rings organisation and throughout history conquers kingdoms and topples governments. In 1996, wanting to expand his power, Wenwu goes in search for Ta Lo, a mystical heavenly realm inhabited by Chinese mythological creatures. He travels through a magical forest to the Ta Lo village entrance but is stopped by guardian Ying Li (Fala Chen). The two fall in love, but Li leaves with Wenwu when he is rejected by the villagers. Wenwu abandons the Ten Rings, and they have two children, Shang-Chi and Xialing. When Shang-Chi is seven years old (Jayden Zhang), Li is murdered by Wenwu's enemies, the Iron Gang. Wenwu once again wields the rings to massacre the Iron Gang, resumes leadership of his organisation, and has Shang-Chi go through brutal training in martial arts. Xialing from childhood (Elodie Fong) secretly copies this training. When Shang-Chi is fourteen (Arnold Sun), Wenwu sends him to assassinate the leader of the Iron Gang. But Shang-Chi is demoralised after fulfilling his mission and decides to run away to America, settling in San Francisco and changing his name to ""Shaun"". In the present day, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) works as a valet with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina), who knows nothing about his past. They are attacked on a bus by the Ten Rings, led by high-ranking agent Razor Fist (Florian ""Big Nasty"" Munteanu) who steal a pendant that Shang-Chi was given by his mother. Wenwu anonymously provides Shang-Chi with the location of his sister and, fearing that the Ten Rings will go after Xialing's matching pendant from their mother, Shang-Chi decides to meet her. He reveals his past to Katy, who insists on helping him. They find Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) at an underground fight club in Macau, which she founded after escaping from Wenwu. The Ten Rings attack the fight club and Wenwu arrives to capture Shang-Chi, Katy, Xialing, and her pendant. They are taken to the Ten Rings' compound, where Wenwu uses the pendants to reveal a magical map leading to Ta Lo. Wenwu explains that he has heard Li calling to him and believes she is alive and being held captive in Ta Lo behind a sealed gate. He plans to destroy the village unless they release her. When Shang-Chi, Xialing and Katy object, Wenwu imprisons them. Also incarcerated is former actor Trevor Slattery (Sir Ben Kingsley), whom the Ten Rings imprisoned for impersonating Wenwu, as The Mandarin, and his hundun companion Morris, who offers to guide them to Ta Lo. The group escapes and travel to Ta Lo, which exists in a separate dimension with various Chinese mythological creatures. They meet Ying Nan (Michelle Yeoh), Li's sister, who explains the history of Ta Lo: thousands of years ago, the village was attacked by the soul-consuming Dweller-in-Darkness and its minions but was saved by a Chinese dragon called the Great Protector who helped seal the Dark Gate to the Dweller's world. According to Nan, the Dweller-in-Darkness has been influencing Wenwu to believe Li is still alive so that he will open the Gate. Shang-Chi, Xialing, and Katy join the villagers in training and preparing for Wenwu's arrival, using outfits and weapons crafted from dragon scales. Wenwu and the Ten Rings arrive and attack. Wenwu overpowers Shang-Chi and forces him into the nearby lake, then destroys the Gate with the rings. Some of Dweller's minions escape, and the villagers join forces with the Ten Rings to fight them. Shang-Chi is revived by the Great Protector, which leaves the lake to battle the minions. Wenwu and Shang-Chi fight once more, with Shang-Chi gaining the upper hand, but he chooses to spare his father. The Dweller-in-Darkness escapes the weakened Gate and attacks Shang-Chi. Wenwu saves his son, bequeathing him the rings before being killed by the Dweller-in-Darkness. The Dweller-in-Darkness is eventually killed by the combined efforts of Shang-Chi, the Great Protector, Xialing, and Katy. Following the battle, Shang-Chi and Katy return to San Francisco where they are summoned by the sorcerer Wong (Benedict Wong) to the Sanctum Sanctorum. In a mid-credits scene, Wong introduces Shang-Chi and Katy to Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Carol Danvers (Brie Larson). They discover that the ten rings are emitting a mysterious signal. In a post-credits scene, Xialing becomes the new leader of the Ten Rings after telling Shang-Chi that she was going to disband the organisation. Also starring Ronny Chieng as Jon Jon, Tsai Chin as Waipo, Yuen Wah as Master Guang Bo, Jodi Long as Mrs. Chen, Dallas Liu as Ruihua, Paul He as Chancellor Hui and Tsai Chin as Katy's grandmother, with the voice of Tim Roth as Abomination. Liu is suited nicely as the lead hero, Awkwafina is loveable as the hero's high-spirited best friend, Leung is interesting as the half-hero half-villain father, and there is good support from the likes of Yeoh and Kingsley. It is a simple story of a young man who must confront his past and use his mastery in weaponry-based Kung Fu to save the world, the highlights are the fight on the speeding bus and the final epic battle featuring dragons and mythical monsters, I agree the excellent special effects may swamp a lot of what is going on, but a well-written script, many fast-paces sequences, moments of humour, and nods to past martial arts movies help to smooth things out, all together it is an entertaining superhero fantasy action. Good!"
Best origin story from the MCU in a looooong time.
"Not the best but not the worst marvel movie. Somewhat forgettable, but still enjoyable. The humor helped."
"Twelve year old me loved this movie. It is big, bold, colourful, action packed, fun, funny, and has flying dragons. Cranky codger me says no to flying dragons. Sorry to any preteens peeking in (highly unlikely), flying dragons are a silly figment of someone's imagination. A movie with flying dragons is difficult to take seriously. Sorry kids. There is also some shocking news about Santa Clause, but let's save that for another day.The good news here: Marvel again steps up to the plate in their inclusivity transformation of what movie making can and should be. They also manage to keep the rest of their superhero Universe from ruining what is a pretty good martial arts film by inserting the briefest of brief Marvel cameos to keep the all important story arc threaded. As usual for the studio, the supporting cast is pretty sweet. Ben Kingsley with a Ringo accent absolutely slays. Ronnie Chieng in a brief but outrageous cameo absolutely slays. Awkwafina in a major cameo absolutely slays. Tony Leung as the dark father and ring master absolutely slays, slays a lot.The bad news: let's face facts, it may not be possible to make a good martial arts movie. Just when things get interesting we get a fight sequence where combatants, while absorbing what should be lethal blows, magically fly backwards unscathed. Zero gravity time baby! Why is this a thing? Used to be done with wires, so very obvious, and oddly enough, even with CGI at the ready, we still get that bizarre old school wire look. Homage has its limits. And lastly and most sadly the rousing cast of secondary characters pretty well squeezes Simu Liu into a not so main character role. Kinda forgettable if truth be told. That's a problem. A big problem.The really cool highlights in ""Shang-Chi"", like the morphing forest maze, are a series of disconnected sequences that seem parachuted in, not integral to the story. As is often the case in the Marvel Universe, someone in the art department went a little crazy. With ""Black Panther"" it was the robot rhinos, and here it is a bizarre shimmering, sequinned horse hybrid (a hornless unicorn, so a nocorn?). Oh and then there are the cute furry, winged animals (get ready for the Xmas plush toy stampede) who somehow survive without any orifices. No really: nothing goes in, nothing goes out, and yet it survives, and also communicates!Shame about all these niggling details, but they do ruin what could be a grand cinematic experience, an epic of epic proportions, though relentlessly formulaic, a family affair that nicks Shakespearian conflict, culminating with volcanic battle scenes of archery, catapults, swords, and uh, oh yeah, flying dragons.The Marvel Universe is making strides, especially with the dark and moody ""Black Widow"", and the hilariously over the top, potty-mouthed ""Deadpool"". ""Shang-Chi"" is a heroic stray away from the usual masked heroes in tights genre, but it just needs less than more. A lot less. Chop chop.Twelve year olds rejoice!hipCRANK."
"As with all Marvel movies, the ending tries so hard to be enormous that it becomes visually impossible to comprehend. I would like it if just one of these superhero movies had a character think and talk their way out of a threat to humanity. Nevertheless, this is one of the better attempts... Primarily because it is a well acted origin story with a minimal amount of heart and soul. Be thankful for small mercies!"
It had a lot of funny scenes and great action scenes. The movie was great.
"Ever wonder what it's like to be in a drug induced coma and have psychedelic experiences? That's what this movie was. Absolutely nothing made sense from beginning to end, it was a chaotic mess, endless flashbacks, pitiful attempts to tug at heart strings, and I really hoped Gozilla was gonna show up and kill everyone off. Keep churning out the garbage Hollywood, burn baby burn."
"Shang Chi was an amazing original story and one of the best MCU Movies to date.Tons and tons of actions and the end battle scene was completely next level!Great supporting characters and cameos, along with just enough detail into more Mystic Arts."
"For all intents and purposes this movie was your typical DC movie. And, for a MARVEL film that's every bit the insult it is intended to be. The over-the-top praise this effort has generated is either born from pure loyal slappies or people wishing to seem culturally progressive praising a ridiculously shallow cotton candy movie.Every character is superficial and the lead has the charisma of wet bread. The story itself is basic and never gives the viewer a chance to connect with ANY character or even their motivations. The tone jumps everywhere as if the director was handed a jigsaw puzzle worth of scenes and asked to string them together to frame CGI madness. Honestly from the completely silly over-the-top opening bus brawl through the insane CGI third act dragon fight, I don't remember ever rolling my eyes so much at a Marvel Studios endeavor. Well, maybe the third act of Black Widow but that just makes me realize how far Phase Four has wandered away from what made the MCU great. There are some visually stunning scenes and an overall good idea at play but everything falls in to some sort of kiddy cartoon category where nothing has any consequence either physically or emotionally."
"The Visual effects is great. The problem is with the whole story. The first half was pretty boring. They same typical storyline of women victimhood. Where city people are regressive, where else people from the village are so progressive. Woke 101.Some of the storyline are quite similar to Iron man. Where father plays the important role.But special effects are really good.There is a big surprise towards the end."
"I convinced my friend to go see this tonight based on the high score and positive reviews, but the movie turned out to be a real let down.Extremely predictable, no suprises whatsoever. The jokes never really landed for me and most the characters invovlved were there soly for comic relief. Hocus Pocus Jackie Chan martial arts scenes that has no anchoring in reality.Main antagonists motives were very unclear, did he simply go mad after 1000 years of sanity? And Main character learned how to use the rings better than his father after 10 seconds, what the actual? Very unlikable side-characters introduced, what were the studio thinking going into this?Very obvvious that they cramed in the monster fight at the end just to have visual spectable. Disney animals everywhere, this is without a doubt the most Goofy Marvel movie as of yet.Visual team did a great job though with the CGI, therefore 4/10."
"It feels like a mash up of about 10 old movies anc 20 plots weaved into one film, for me I didn't enjoy it very much, there were positives but overall I didn't leave feeling like I'd seen something that special. It didn't feel like a marvel film, I'm not against diversity or going in different directions but it just wasn't a film I loved or would see again. The characters were bland and uninspiring, the humour was ok but bit same old same old and the plot which I'd guess you'd call the main theme felt a bit daft.The cgi was awesome, graphics, choreography and costumes all really nice, parts were genuinely beautiful but if the film ain't doing much for me that doesn't matter.Think a lot would hinge on whether you got this gimmick or liked it, I didn't, they were cool for set pieces and what they wanted to achieve in the movie but I just felt they weren't something I thought was interesting or that impressive.It was always going one way, it was pretty predictable and I didn't feel or believe the emotion as I found the story a bit stupid, it just felt directionless and they were trying to do so much whilst achieving very little.It felt long to, much longer than the run time, it just wasn't a film I'd recommend and it was one I felt disappointed.I maybe backwards though as everyone's saying this makes up for black widow, I don't get that, I thought black widow was brilliant. Way better than this.Also it seems if it's Asian and a bit funny everyone calls awkwafina."
"Action great (except cacophonous dragon fight), acting decent, visuals good, story predictable...the whole this is fine, but I have a more pressing matter to address here. I have yet to watch an MCU movie and felt like I got enough Wong. More Wong. Always more Wong."
"Fair origin film. Generally, Marvel's character introduction films are slightly above average affairs. They need to introduce a character that some people may not be familiar with. This usually leads to a lengthy stretch of the beginnings of those movies to be slow. This movie, however, felt like it kicked off fairly quickly and maintained a decent pace. After the ramp up to Infinity War and Endgame, and bombastic, wild action in them, this movie feels like a step back. However, you need to keep in mind that this is the beginning of a new story arc in the MCU. Build up is necessary. In that regard, this movie is a success.With that said, I do have a few gripes.Awkwafina grated on my ears and nerves for the whole movie. A personal preference. I don't remove a star for that.Many of the action sequences were well done but filmed with the cameras too close. Had they been filmed from a greater distance they would have been more impressive and flowed better overall.That's pretty much it. I found it to be one of the better origin films. Nothing spectacular, but it was VERY watchable."
"Different to Black Panther, who had been already introduced in Civil War, Shang-Chi is presented from scratch using an arch we're all already too familiar with, but adding lots of new characters, martial arts and a glimpse to a new universe inside the MCU. Although at some moments abusing the use of fantastical elements, Ben Kingsley and Awkwafina provide the comic relief the MCU has gotten us used to. Super enjoyable!Marvel might have its own highs and lows, but it always delivers."
"Eluding his difficult past, a young man from China has been content playing it safe in San Francisco for the past several years even though he lacks a true sense of self. But when drastic circumstances draw him back to his conspicuous origins, he has no choice but to face his demons head on. Continuing to expand its cultural horizon the MCU's first Asian-centric movie has unique choreography, a dazzling visual scheme, splendid hand-to-hand combat, and of course the expected teases going forward, but some of the more elaborate action set pieces lack needed tension, much of the exposition and backstory isn't very engaging, and up until the third act many of the emotional aspects of the narrative aren't as rich or compelling as they could be. Some of the humor is strained, but it's efficiently cast and provides enough to be a distinctive entry into the Marvel world. **¬Ω"
"It had the potential to be one of the best Marvel movies I've seen with its music, great action sequences and cinematography, but they wasted it. There are so many silly jokes and no scene made me laugh except for the ones in Fake Mandarin. Let's come to the character of Kathy... The acting of the woman is bad, the character is unnecessary. If it wasn't in the movie, nothing would have changed. It is also absurd that someone who has probably never seen an arrow in her life can become an arrow master in one day. The scene where Shang Chi's parents fought was not a fight but a dance, it was really bad. That's it. Movie isn't a bad movie but it could better."
"The movie is pretty good in most ways, but Akwafina's character is just... annoying. Sorry I didn't like her in this."
MY RIVEIW THAT I WRITE ON SEPTMBER 2 WAS DELETED SO I WILL WRITE A NEW RIVEIW BEST MARVEL FILM EVER! SHOW US SOMETHING THAT WE NEVER GOT TO SEEN (IN A GOOD WAY) AND I LIKE IT AND I CANT WAIT TO MEET SHANG CHI AGIAN AND SEE SHANG CHI 2!
"This movie sucks, just like Jorge la mierda. But is better than iron man 3."
"This film, had everything I was hoping for and more! It paid tribute to the classic kung-fu films it took inspiration from and added that marvel cinematic universe flare as well!"
"For an MCU movie, i've seen better, and the movie still not on the level like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Panther, Ant Man, and even Black Widow the recent one before this that everybody hate or think it just an alright film but i found it way better than this and it's a perfect movie (in terms of an MCU superhero solo movie), Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is still an exciting film with a dazzling special and visual effects, incredible action packed, and amazing performance, though the second part/place in the movie didn't work perfectly, and Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is not one of my favorite and probably the least in the franchise and character but overall movie is still great."
"I have low expectation for this one but this movie proved I am wrong. This movie exceed my expectations in all aspect. They got great heart-touching story, funny moments (a lot of funny scene. I can hear people laugh here and there. I love how Awkwafina can be both funny and beautiful at the same time, I became her fans in this movie), great costumes, moral of the story, etc.This is only my personal opinion but I think the MC is kinda flat in personality. I can't really sympathy with him. The sidekicks in this story have more interesting background or personality (for ex. Katy, the little sister/xiangling, the father) than the MC.The only downside that really disappointing is the final battle because they overuse CGI and the CGI looks like a cheap budget movie. The best fighting scene they have is the fight in the bus."
"First thing first, this film is great, visually a treat for any lover of cinema, combat fighting and some well timed comedic moments but the story leaves something to be desired.Simu Liu as a leading man in this movie is great to embody this character. He's fighting prowess can probably only be matched to the daredevil Tv series in such choreographed fight scenes. Very different styles but this follows effortlessly from him during this movie. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, What more can be said about this performance! As the true Mandarin i would love to have seen him face off against iron man, the power creep is massive but this would be epic! Awkwafina just annoying the only words i want to talk about her character, when she was falling from the bamboo scaffolding i hoped that was the end of her arc. Michelle Yeoh and Meng'er Zhang we good for supporting roles but nothing really different we've seen in the past. Mother figure after their actual mother has been killed and then the ambitious sister that always feels hard done by and in the shadow of her bother.By the end of the film they all band together to defeat the bad guy standard stuff! That portal at the end is that a path to the Dark dimension? Maybe something thats going to be explored in Doctor Strange 2. Wong and the Abominations appearance has already been revealed. Nice details placed in those moments with Wong return Abomination to the raft.Overall the action was great, casting for the leads perfect, the story was very simple and no real revelations by the end of it. Does this beat Iron Man, no, Captain america the first avenger, close but yes, Thor, yes, Captain marvel, 10000%, Ant Man, nope. Middle of the road first movie with a lot to build on!!"
"The movie is very entertaining, with a great cast. The fighting scenes are intense and beautiful. There are no noticeable plot holes. Tony Leung is amazing as alawys, and Sim Liu did a great job too."
It is amazing Marvel movie it is some different things from regular Marvel movies I like so much you must have was this one.
Good movie! I enjoyed watching it! What a good movie! Good! Movie!
I just don't understand why this flick got such high ratings. You can go crazy with special effects but if the acting is poor and the attempts to bring some humor u can trow this whole concept in the bin. The humor is what makes me connect with the actor's in most of the marvel films. This was really lame as and it made me want to leave the theater everytime a lame ass attempt to have some sort of funny dialogue. The main characters are not very strong characters. Most of the dialogue was annoying. I just don't understand other reviews and why this film is rated so good. Its not only about special effects.
"Shang Chi brings a lot of new dynamics to the MCU that have not been done in any of the subsequent Marvel movies to this point. The fight choreography with fantastic martial arts action being beautifully captured and edited to perfection, the accompanying score that really paces the scenes well, and at times breath taking cinematography. However, particularly in the third act, it tends to fall back on the tried and true Marvel formula that is become tiresome to even someone like me who is a huge Marvel fanboy. The Mandarin is one of the greatest MCU villains we have ever seen. I wish this was the true Iron Man 3 villain. However there is comic relief and exposition characters accompanying our heroes throughout much of the film that takes the bite out of the stakes. The third act continues with the faceless army versus B characters complete with a huge CGI spectacle at the end. You can seek how this borrows from other firms prior, particularly Black Panther. A fun watch, but unfortunately not the home run they were going for."
"His sister learned martial arts by just watching? Genius? How come she just got sidelined the entire rest of the movie? When the aunt got introduced to Shang Chi how come she didn't talk to his sister? How is an ancient thousand year warlord not a master of martial arts? How does Shang Chi learn his mother's martial art in 7 min? Why does aquafinas character not feel like it fits in the entire time? It feels like she didn't fit. They didn't speak enough Chinese, outside of LA and aquafina, they should not have spoken English."
"So beautiful, I just loved it. The acting is great, the story line is good, the villain makes sense and has depth. I'm all for it. Probably the best marvel movie so far in my opinion up there with Guardians of the Galaxy. The humour even made sense. The scenes outside the sisters fight club were shot so well and the foo dogs were just glorious to see."
Very enjoyable addition to the Marvel Franchise.The lead actors are excellent and the storyline picks up pace.I particularly like the US action sequences.Sequel looks primed....
"As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge. That particular film was such a perfect finale for the series that I have struggled with the efforts to get the storyline going again. It doesn't help that they have been so scattered in topics, lacking a single core group to bring them all together. Shang-Chi is another random hero that I only knew vaguely from references in the comics, but I never read any of his books back when I was a collector. I appreciated that this film brought a new style to a MCU movie. The blending of Wuxia into a superhero story was a fun choice.There were also quite a few great actors in this film including Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh, and I'd even include Awkwafina in that category. I can certainly see how some other people might struggle with Awkwafina's schtick, but I find her comedic timing to be great, and I was laughing along the whole time. However, the one major name I left out of the ""great actors"" is Simu Liu. Sadly, I found him a little bland. He was okay with the comedy, but I certainly don't see him stacking up with the legends that have come before in the MCU. Heck, Benedict Wong has only about 5 minutes of screentime in this film, but still made a greater impression on me than Simu Liu.Digging into the story of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, I'd say it's a fine origin story, even if it was highly predictable. This is the kind of movie where you can stay 10 steps ahead of it, and that is unfortunate. I think that's the biggest problem with the entire film, while it's fun and engaging it also feels like a rough carbon copy of things that came before. It's a movie that is emulating a number of Wuxia films from the past, but it's not as good as any of them. It's a movie that is following the tropes of a superhero origin story, and once again isn't on the level of the best of the genre. You can't fault their ambition, but their execution was lacking.All that negativity is not to say that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a bad film. In fact, I enjoyed the entire time in the theater, and was genuinely invested in the story. I thought it handled the links to the MCU well, but without feeling like it had shameless pandering for the fans, or devolving into obscure references only people like myself would understand. The film had some gorgeous visuals, and created its own world in a way that managed to be both unique but still consistent with the style of other MCU movies. There were personal stakes in the film, despite the fact that the ending fell into a giant CGI battle that felt unnecessary. I can't say that Shang-Chi will rise into the upper echelon of my MCU rankings, but it's better than some that came before."
"Car valet (Liu) and his friend are attacked by warriors working for his father who is a 1,000 year old owner of the 10 rings which gives him phenomenal powers. He and his sister are eventually captured by their father who reveals what his strange intentions are and how they fit in.Wonderful action packed fantasy adventure is brilliantly bought to life by a great cast and some great action sequences including some staggeringly beautiful fantasy scenes. Extraordinary how this almost child like fantasy film can so successfully bridge a chase scene across modern day San Francisco with battles with dragons whilst maintaining a goodly degree of drama snd humour. Huge fun."
"If you liked:
Jackie Chan films
Bruce Lee films
Doctor StrangeNote: as I always say Marvel and DC films can really only be compared to one another, within their own segment of the movie industry. But even if I were to compare ""Shang-Chi"" to any other film, it would have been a 9/10.A perfect Marvel movie. Trust me, I've watched all 25 of them and the only Marvel films that come close to the richness of story, character development and sheer epicness of Shang-Chi are Doctor Strange, Thor Ragnarok and the last two Avengers. The film perfectly balances story and character development with action scenes so that throughout the whole two hours you never get tired of neither. There are no unnecessary filler scenes, there aren't any 40-min long scenes explaining the childhood background of the main character you sometimes see in such films; the flashbacks of the past are smartly intertwined as short clips within the overarching main story. The fights are absolutely amazing, obviously inspired by Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee moves (with a pinch of Kill Bill). The story is as deep and as personal as it can get for a Marvel film (honestly better than most drama films nowadays); and some scenes are as epic and vast as the final battles in Endgame or the last Hobbit movie. This is what Mulan and Raya should have looked like. And the great thing is that it doesn't rely on any of the previous Marvel movies whatsoever - a fully standalone project with completely new characters.You must watch it in a theater if you can."
"HUGE step-up from Black Widow. This movie made it onto my top 3 favorite MCU movies list.The new unique MCU origin story of Shang-Chi wasn't that original but it was still very fun to go through. Sometimes you forget you're watching a Marvel movie. Everything from the visuals, music and fight choreography was amazing and on point. There was also a good amount of humor inside but also a good amount of touching moments.If you can see it, you should definitely go see it."
"Overall, I really liked the film, but I don't think it's what the reviews are making it to be. Definitely one of the most over-praised ever, in my opinion.Let's start with the things I liked, and this is definitely the beginning, the first act. Mandarin's brutal battle with the armies hints at the epic and great effects that await us and the power of the rings. Also, the director manages to introduce us to the main characters - Shang Chi and Katie and the great chemistry between them, with very few and correctly shot scenes. The two radiate a very pleasant warmth and you really feel their friendship. We also witness two of the best-made battle scenes I've seen in a movie, the one on the Bus and on the scaffolding around the skyscraper. Maybe that's where the problem is rooted and the film gets a little underwhelming over time, because these scenes were so good that nothing could reach them afterwards, especially the CG fest, which turned out to be the finale.Another plus I can point out, as a consequence of the above is the directing itself, the cinematography and the music. The film looks and is shot beautifully, colorful when needed, without overdoing it, the same with the gloomy scenes (which makes me angry that I had to wear the damn 3D glasses again). Scenes inspired by old Chinese classics such as ""Hero"", ""House of the Flying Daggers"" and ""Tiger and Dragon"" were great, poetic and with enough respect for these old classics! The battle scenes were also an absolute peak and as I said - the scaffolding scene can be a master class on how to shoot one. The music also contributed very nicely with the light chill beats, perfectly complementing the urban scenes and the epic Asian notes included in the fairytale segments. Some of the acting surprised me a little - most were good, especially Tony Leung as the father. And, would you believe it - Aquafina or whatever that name is. I didn't expect her to surprise me so pleasantly at all, but I liked her even more than the main guy Simu, who was honestly wooden at times, despite his charisma. Congratulations to the actress who played Shong Chi's mother, she was wonderful. I will also mention the relatively funny cameo from a rather controversial character that we remember from Iron Man 3 :)And in this line of thought - to say the things that did not work for me. Namely, the fairy-tale / fantasy part, as well as the seriously slugish second act, where I think they went too far with the flashbacks, the exposition and the dramatization. I don't know, maybe the problem is in me, but as things started to move into the dimension of fairy tales and fantasy, somehow that took me out of the movie. It came to me too abruptly and unexpectedly to be SO made up. Especially after the super well done scenes happening on Earth. Also, when the whole mystery began to unfold, there were too long scenes with silence, dramatic looks, explanations, exposure, flashbacks, that started to lose me a little and roll my eyes.The final act, unfortunately, is a typical Marvel / superhero epic with a bit too much monsters, creatures and fiction that I could handle. I understand that the film is a cultural phenomenon, especially for China, and they wanted to weave culture, mythology, legends into one, but even though we have witnessed all sorts of cosmic and fantastic wonders in this universe - something about these dragons and wonders took me out slightly from the movie. I would accept them much better in animated / comic form.However, the very way it ends, where things became more grounded again and even the characters explained with self-irony and joked about what happened, was great and definitely raised my rating slightly. Also the fantastic mid-credit scene.After all that has been said, it is very difficult for me to find a correct assessment of the film. On the one hand, seven is not enough for me, eight is too much for me, so I nail it to * 7.5 / 10 *"
"Loved the Action sequences & Charectors. At the end story feels so simple & old. That being said, I'm really looking forward to the upcoming Marvel films to see how this charector gonna evolve."
"It's always fun to go to the theater for a new MCU production -- a chance to see something **new** that you know will be well produced and will keep on stretching their shared universe of superheros. With Shang-Chi it looks like their Phase 4 is well and truly launched, and you can already glimpse what Marvel Studios' overall approach is going to be. (More below.)Just like Black Widow was Marvel's run at doing a James Bond-type film, Shang-Chi is their try at doing the Chinese martial arts thing. The result is a kind of compromise Westernized version that falls between two poles. For sure though, you'll be entertained. There's more than enough action, a lot of strikingly beautiful settings, and fun characters. But before I forget -- the mid-credits scene is one of the best they've ever done and totally worth staying for. (That's where the quote I put in the title above comes from -- a certain familiar character telling Shang-Chi to sure, come on in and join the craziness.) It does the usual thing of tossing the baton forward to whatever the next production will be, but it's stylistically so clever that it really stands out.And the film itself: it fills up its 2:12 runtime with a whole lot of material and a lot of characters. Maybe too much. The third act in particular veers off onto a fantasy-type track that doesn't entirely fit well with the previous hour and a half of setup, and the scenes in that last section suddenly feel more rushed. Gone are the days of the first Iron Man or Thor or Ant-Man movies with their lean, linear storylines and single well defined themes. Instead, Marvel now seems to want to overstuff every one of their productions, even if they involve 'secondary' MCU characters, and turn them into epics. More and bigger is not always better, is it?I did like the cast. Marvel always does an impressive job bringing in good people. Nice to see there are no less than 4 (!) major roles for females, as opposed to 2 for males, and they mix and match well. Of the mostly young cast though, I thought the older pair (Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh) really stood out -- they effortlessly dominate the screen when they are on. Leung's character could have been a stock, one-dimensional scenery-chewing villain, but he's much more nuanced than that. Simu Liu (the lead role, Shang-Chi) is not exactly a great actor just yet, but he's athletic and cute and attractive with a sense of humor and for this role he doesn't need to be much more than that. Awkwafina, as Katy, does her usual turn with comic relief and side commentary with a dash of romance. As for Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley) -- that came out of nowhere and he's absolutely out of place, but somehow it works partly because of his pet that rises to Disney levels of cuteness.About Phase 4. The first three cycles introduced and used particular major characters that were all required to fit under the Avengers umbrella. Now it's the post-Avengers era and from their scheduled series of releases up through 2023, we'll see a much more diverse slate of characters and stories that don't obviously fall under a single umbrella. If they do have a Master Plan for something equivalent to the Avengers, it's hard to see what it is. Maybe, they'll use this new freedom just to show us interesting stories in a bigger universe."
"Greatly done movie with great characters. The best part of this movie is it's action, beautiful visually and made to perfection. This is not only one of my new favourite Marvel movies but also one of my favourite superhero movies."
"Effectively an origin story for Shang-Chi that marries the styles of superhero and martial art films wonderfully, and adds some much needed intrigue back into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).I did legitimately enjoy the movie! It tries new things and is one of the more enjoyable MCU films. However, it did not quote tip the scale into becoming one of the best MCU movies in my opinion. At times, it felt a little too fantastical for my liking (especially the third act).The story, visuals, and characters are all pretty great! But I find the film mostly suffered from an ending that could have been more grounded in reality than it was. I am happy though, to see Shang-Chi added into the MCU."
This movie always stole my heart's whole partüî•üî•‚ù§‚ù§... This is the best single hero movie i had ever seen‚ù§
A well made hero and villain. A great watch in the theatre!
"What a movie...fantastic..a superhero movie that's been excellent visual treat too....so very beautifully crafted...
Story telling...graphics...charectorization name the department it excels...
This is a must watch...I love the MCU Universe...but this stands apart for its amazing story telling and visuals...."
"Nice start for Asian power in mainstream US- very first superhero. The movie has really nice cinematography and choreography. The fight scenes were excellent. Director really knows how to create a suspense- already marvel standard now. The problem with this movie is that everybody important is good person. There is no bad person in this movie, so there's not enough conflict. At the end, they have to come up with a dragon out of nowhere to be the big boss which doesn't quite make sense. By the way, Liang Chaowei is really fashionable and young looking in this movie, great for people in his 60s. Liu Simu delivered a good performance."
"I've just come out of the cinema and I'm in awe of how beautiful this movie was. It was visually stunning: rich in colour and graphics. The costumes, cinematography and set were outstanding. The music was wonderful. There were funny moments, heart felt moments and edge of your seat moments. Everything that a Marvel movie should be and more. It made me so happy to see the Asian community finally being represented in the Marvel universe. Acting was insane. I absolutely love Akwafina. Go and watch this at the cinema if you can- it is so worth it to see the beauty on the big screen."
"An enjoyable film, showing Shang Chi's family history from his fathers side.I found it laughable when his sister, excluded from Kung-Fu training with the men of the Ten Rings, said she watched from afar and trained herself and became better than the men of the Ten Rings.More of that Yay girl power non-sense."
"Likeable main characters and with some fantastic action scenes, this is an overall solid film! The plot/dialogue (like many marvel films) is a little thin, and is poor in some places, which lets the film down slightly in some areas. Overall a decent watch!"
Touch of the mystic in its story and direction. Visuals and fight scenes are great and the main characters are extremely likeable. It even has a villain which you can understand.
"The movie is long and kinda boring.But it has great comedy
A hand-to-hand fight like Jackie Chan
It contains a very wonderful fantasy world with dragons."
Tony leung I will no longer be a minor in a few months :)
"I thought that this movie was pretty good. I was very excited going into it, and it seemed like it was going to be a fun time. I was right, the fights were great, it was unique and the cg was really good (for the most part) and almost all the characters felt really well developed. However: I thought the pacing felt way too fast. It seemed like Shang chi went from good martial artists to a master of these new abilities he's never learned before. Also, the movie couldn't quite decide on the tone. Half the time it was funny, and the other half it wanted to be dark. Other than that, I thought it was a good movie and it'll be interesting to see where the MCU takes this character. Definitely worth a watch."
One of the best mcu movies tbh I really liked the concept and story.
"Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him. Although I have a really deep criticism over fase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I've decided to go watch the movie in theaters (after two years of being away from theaters due to covid). Overall I really enjoyed it. There were still a few moments that I regretted and that were dull. Not to mention ""little mistakes"" that Marvel keep doing with their movies. In general it was a fun experience. The plot didn't have much to offer to be honest: another origin story of a superhero that tries to run away from his fate and responsibilities. Until he is forced to face his past.This has been the kind of way for Marvel to introduce their new characters in the MCU, I wished they would have been more creative but they do deliver creativity for once. Watching people speak their native language for once was a huge step up for Marvel. The movie is also influenced by many other asian classic films such as ""Hero"", ""Hidden Dragon"", ""Seven Samurai"" and ""In the mood for love"".Of course it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without some end credits scenes (how original). The end credit scene does confirm the return of Shang Chi at some point, but what the end credits scene does confirm moreover is how the future Marvel films will all get connected. As I said before, I'm less optimistic with this whole fase 4 of Marvel but it wouldn't hurt or kill to watch a few of them. To me, I just wanted to return to the theaters.Speaking of actors: Simu Liu is a fantastic actor and will definitely become a fan favorite, both him and his character. Awkwafina steals the show every single time she's on screen. Tony Leung is wonderful and acts so well. The whole cast is perfect. If you are in favor of theaters and Marvel movies than go watch Shang Chi.P. S: the end credit song - Fire in the Sky by Anderson Paak. Is the best part of the movie."
"When Marvel first announced its Phase 4, I admit that I wasn't exactly excited about Shang-Chi. I had never even heard of the hero, so I was a lot more hyped for Spiderman and Doctor Strange than a complete unknown.Watching the movie, I was pleasantly surprised. Simu Liu is very likable as the main character, while Tony Leung is a big name in China and he demonstrates why. The man is a criminal who trained his own child as an assassin, yet through his acting you still feel sympathy for him when he broods over his lost love.The fighting scenes are also exceptionally well done and visually the movie is stunning, trying to incorporate some oriental elements into the MCU.Sure there are some woke snippets here and there, they sadly seem mandatory for any movie these days. Things like Katy mastering archery in a couple of days or Shang-Chi's sister teaching herself combat because their father wouldn't train a girl and despite that, somehow being on the main character's level. But you can overlook these with a little effort.If there is one thing I did not enjoy, it's the scenes with the dragon. I feel that it bogged down the movie with an unnecessary cgi-fest. For me, it would have served the movie a lot better if the story focused on pure combat and the 10 rings themselves. I would have also liked to see Shang-Chi struggle more with his upbringing. It would have made his character a lot more interesting and nuanced than presenting a child assassin as a well adjusted typical American.Despite the above points which in my eyes are missed opportunities, the movie was definitely better than I expected and the mere fact that I look forward to seeing more of Shang-Chi, makes me count this as a win for Marvel."
"As others have mentioned the fight choreography is probably the best to date in the MCU. Long panning shots like The Raid, John Wick, Daredevil (Netflix series), where it's almost like the punches actually land, and the use of the environment is almost comical in how ridiculous these fights become. The score reminded me of Black Panther where they incorporate some pretty awesome hip hop tracks, whereas in Black Panther some of the score felt forced and out of place, this films bass drops and transition to versus added a pretty slick feel to the film. Unlike other most MCU entries post Avengers, this film didn't seem to focus on the grand plans ahead in the MCU which is okay, I personally expected a little more. I also felt like the motivations of the villain were unclear for a large portion of the film, it was hard to feel connected to any particular cause. Some of the dialogue was stilted, jokes landed less often than usual and there were a couple moments that took you out of the film. Overall, it's a fun film with unique qualities that any fan of the genre should enjoy."
I'll keep it short & sweet. This way exceeded my expectations. I was kinda burnt out on marvel & didn't love the stuff they were putting out in phase 4 but this was awesome and the hype is back baby! Post credit scenes are hinting at some big stuff make sure to stick around!
"Stunts and fight scenes are best..
But story could be better."
"Shang-Chi and the legend of Sumi Liu is gorgeous is a totally fine Marvel movie, where, like every marvel movie, someone is upset that someone kinder than them dies and even though that person told them this isn't the way, the decided to fight and kill people for revenge. Then someone else teaches them that, just like the kinder person who they are upset about said, stop using anger to solve your problems.Apparently the moral is that women who are younger, more beautiful, smarter, more powerful, and kinder shouldn't settle. Even if their kids end up with the pretty genes, destruction will reign because their dad just isn't good enough, and clearly knows it."
"Technically Strong Movie. All Action Scenes Are Amazing... CG was Superb, Fun and Emotional Mixed Entertainer...
Welcome On Board A New Av‚ú®üí•‚ú®R..
Over All Shangi-Chi Awesome."
"The vibe of the film is just so nice and I don't know why. Action scenes were great especially the martial arts. Good villain, you understand why he does those bad things. There is also humor in the film but it always stops at the right moment. So yeah it's a lot better than black widow."
"This one is a very solid entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Great Action and story that catches up with characters like Wong and Abomination. The movie definitely feels different than other Marvel films and origin stories as it gives the villain some motivation that is understandable.Overall, the film is definitely one to watch, and is a great setup film for future MCU projects."
"I really liked how the movie started and went in a certain direction for like the first hour but after that point, the movie suddenly becomes a lot more mystical and decides to sway from its direction which did more harm than good to the movie in my opinion. By the end, I just wanted to watch some cool looking, well choreographed hand-to-hand fight scenes but what I got was characters ""kamehameha""ing each other and gigantic beasts fighting along. But I guess I can't complain, I knew what I was going to get since this is a MCU movie after all."
One of the better marvel movies. The fathers acting was not good. Action was top tier. It was consumed by action. Some would say over-consumed.
The film was good but the final fight dragged on and the build up to the fight was too long and I got bored of the martial arts like an hour in.
"Shang-Chi is a movie that nobody expected. An exemplar with which we were not familiar that, not only knew how to exploit their low expectations to the maximum extent, but also developed a structured and dynamic narrative immersed in a MCU that does not leave much room for new heroes.Shang-Chi made its first appearance in Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin's ""Special Marvel Edition # 15"" (December 1973). A Kung-Fu master created in the middle of the genre's boom in the US in the 1970s, Shang-Chi is quite a quirky character.Played by Simu Liu, the protagonist is embarked on an adventure after being intercepted by ghosts from his past. Full of action, martial arts and a very own and attractive aesthetic, the film unfolds without delay. The scenes are punctual and always add something new. Even with a sense of humor that can get heavy on certain occasions (such as when Katy makes jokes in the middle of life and death situations), Shang-Chi finds its essence, exploits it and ends with a gold ribbon leaving the door open for future aftermath.Marvel and its production team never cease to amaze me with their new films. In a difficult transition period, given the conclusion of the Infinity Saga and the beginning of this new phase, the studio keeps its feet on the ground and continues a coherent thread of its interconnected universe. Regardless of the obvious mentions to the events of ""Avengers Endgame"", Marvel returns to do what it does best: including thousands of references, cameos and winks that leave the geeks like me open-mouthed and with the greed for more.The cast is incredible. I did not know any of the actors beforehand and they all dazzled me with their distinctive personalities and professional interpretations. The studio made a great work in synthetizing the oriental culture¬¥s mythology and beliefs. However, it is true that Shang-Chi continues to be a westernized vision of Asian cultures due to its falls into stereotypes of martial arts and frequent characterizations of the Eastern world in Hollywood. Despite this and to my surprise, Shang-Chi knows how to combine the best of both worlds, using humor as its best tool and taking its time to tell the story, avoiding the rush to get to the action sequences that movies of this kind have suffered
The protagonist's arc is round and fulfilling. It has cohesion and is true to its ideals from beginning to end. Thus, the villain (excellently played by Tony Leung) only contributes to the plot and does not fall into the corner of un-memorable Marvel villains. We send you a greeting, Fake Mandarin. If it hadn't been for the blessing acting skills of RDJ, no one would remember your existence.Furthermore, the film interprets the concept of ""grays"" very well. In a franchise that is ""infantilized"" at times, Shang-Chi does not stutter in telling the hard truths of reality such as unsatisfactory employment, unreal family expectations, childhood trauma, the dilemma about murder, among others. Heroes are not pure white. They have their shortcomings, they fight with their demons and that makes them more credible, more human.With a stellar sound-track, Shang-Chi is one of Marvel's most unexpected gems. It is amazing to feel and denote the love with which these films are made and the fidelity to the source materials. For example, the main character's leitmotif is a work of art and a composition that immerses us even more in the plot. Kevin Feige deserves all the praise, he is truly a man who knows how to sell his product very well and, at the same time, sell us something with great qualitative value.After the post-credits scenes, fans only crave more and rejoice in the near future for what remains of this phase. Now with the recent release of the trailer for the new Spiderman movie, one only has to cross out the days for its premiere and admire the attention to detail that they put into the making of the films, not only as individual creations, but as a large adjoining and a special set of films. Bravo Marvel.PD: I really love Benedict Wong. Is he the ultimate man?"
"Yeah, in the history of marvel no other movie is like Shang chi ...... New concept and new characters and new type of story. That's why I give 2 star.But wait, you gonna disappointe with storyline. Like, story can't attach us like other marvel movie. I gonna reduce 2 star for it.But wait, don't worry. The action scene, visual efects, direction is just awesome..... Too good. Thats why I give 2 stars.Acting. You can't find a single mistake in acting. All of them done their job very well. That's why I will give more 2 stars.The most important thing is emotion. We all know marvel characters are fictional. But we all know how much we have emotional attachment to them. But in this movie this is a weack point. You can't get emotionally attached with the character easily. 1 star is reduce bcz of it.And 1 star added for bieng a marvel fan."
"Yeah.. this is the movie where you find something different from marvel. New concept, new storyline, new character and new type of super power

We know marvel characters are fictional.but we emotionally attached with them. But in this movie. You don't feel any emotion. That's why I reduce 1 star.And the last, 1 star for being a marvel fan.."
"The Marvel come back with typical hero villains movie with some suprised. There is nothing new in story but the movie is cocktail of good action , comdey, family darma and superb eye chaching visuals. Love it."
"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) :
Brief Review -Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty. MCEU's new phase never looked so promising but their products are delivering Better than expected. That Spider Man flick in 2019, right after Endgame, changed many perceptions about Marvel's future and even though couple of their recent series like 'Wanda Vision' and 'Loki' couldn't emerge as clear winners, they have set a solid base for upcoming new stories. Shang-Chi is a new start by all means. Not only because it comes under new phase but mainly because it is a stand-alone film and with a new superhero who is more like using traditional combat methods along with ancient superpowers. When Captain America or Black Panther begun as Stand-alone films, they promised too much and thankfully fulfilled it. Shang-Chi does the same. It may not promise too much like Steve Rogers and Wakanda stories but the point where it ends surely gives us hints of new assembled version of superheroes in Multiverse. Shang-Chi, the master of unarmed weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. The film has major portion covered by Family values and hence, it may look predictable but does not bore at all. Yes, few scenes are outdated and too dramatic as if we are watching a Superhero Film made in 90s but let's just forget those weak points as Shang Chi has excelled in Visual spectacle. The screenplay could have been better in the second half when the big War was supposed to take place but it actually looks tiny one except for those two humongous dragons which might remind you of 'The Hobbit'. Performances by Simu Li, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu are fine according to less potential available for the roles. Actually, the humour and tone of these characters was great. They all looked normal people when they were not fighting and even though the film has ancient refrences, the character don't actually go too deep to become expressive. Director Destin Daniel Cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead, he recovers from the childish entanglement. With super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes, rather makes us forgive it. Overall, Shang Chi is another superb entertainer for Marvel Fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest."
"I walked into this film excited but slightly keeping my expectations at bay, and I walked out slightly disappointed.This movie isn't necessarily bad however, I did quite enjoy it. The action choreography blew me away (bus fight scene was amazing), visuals were probably the most stunning we've ever seen in the MCU, some performances were great and characters were written well (mainly Wenwu), and the cultural appreciation in this film really makes it shine (just like Black Panther). It also introduced us to a new corner in the MCU just like Black Panther and GOTG did and I can't wait for it to be used in future films. I did appreciate that it was at least trying to stray away from the typical Marvel formula by incorporating more emotional weight during the third act climaxHowever, I had a couple issues as well. There was just some characters that I did not care for (mainly Awkwafinia's) and were written quite poorly. The film's pacing also affects it quite a bit as it moves quite slow up until the bus fight, then moves quite rapidly, and slows down when the enter the Ten Rings compound for a needlessly boring exposition scene. The second act of this film was also pretty bad and it had everything that I hate about the current MCU films/tv series. Tons of exposition that could've been explained in a more entertaining way, unnecessary jokes and scenes, and just a slog to get through. I also felt the climax dragged on quite a bit and overall, fell into the usual Marvel formula of a massive CGI fight for the third act which is so overused and boring by nowOverall, I did enjoy my time and found a lot of things to like about it, but unfortunately, just like Black Panther, this film is getting a lot of overrated praise that I think it doesn't deserve.Verdict = 7/10 (better than Black Widow at least)"
"Not bad, but not great. It was kinda like a Spider-Man movie, really. Action packed. Story was just OK. No one's winning an Oscar for the acting or the writing. They kinda mocked how ridiculous the story is at the end, which was cool tho.Actors didn't really sell it for me because most of it was CGI (really excellent CGI) so nobody ever looked like they were in any ACTUAL danger. In fact, everyone doing ""dangerous"" scenes looked pretty clearly like they were just acting concerned on demand, like background extras do. Fun to watch, but I could've waited for TV, honestly."
"At first, it felt like I am watching not a MCU movie: it felt just different.Clearly, Shang-Chi targets the China Market and invites us to embrace the Chinese culture and suddenly, I liked that part about the movie. I've watched few Chinese movies and yet I like this one a lot.Pros:
Cool action, scenes and music. Actually a decent plot. A thorough backstory (given the movie runtime).Cons:
What I really dislike in recent MCU movies is that there is always that one person who is damn silly and ridiculous but is never fun for me: they are always apparent and it's totally clear what's their role in the movie - to make you laugh by their silly jokes and them being sort of 'the third wheel'. I feel cringe. Sorry.Speaking of visuals and unique creations: it didn't impress me. Instead, it felt somewhat underwhelming. I am not saying it was terrible but I definitely seen better VFX production in the MCU and my expectations are higher than what we get in Shang-Chi.In conclusion, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings impressed me and at the same time slightly disappointed me.In the end, it was just a good one for me."
"I'm a strong MCU fan and I'm one of those who enjoy almost everything out there. If there's a bad movie that's fun I'm gonna enjoy it anyway. And I've enjoyed Shang-Chi. And I've laughed, many times.The problem is... I don't know. It doesn't really feel like a Marvel one to me, which doesn't need to be a bad thing but in this case, at least for me, it's not an advantage. It feels like an average Chinese ""kung fu + over-fantastic-Asian-mithology"" one. Gosh, they spend at least the first 10 to 15 minutes of the movie speaking Chinese. True, true, the trailer already sold us that style, but it's way further than what the trailer shows. I'm not a particular fan of that style of movies myself but I did give it a go because... Well, you know. It's Marvel. But it doesn't feel like Marvel, and I only believed that it is because of one small cameo in the middle of the movie, because of the last scene and because of the middle-credits one.That's the thing. If Shang-Chi wasn't a Marvel one, I don't believe I'd seen it at all because, as I said, Chinese fantasy-kung fu movies are not my thing, so I guess that's on me.But yeah. It was fun nevertheless."
